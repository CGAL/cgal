To compile, you need support for Eigen

Program Single_estimation
--------------------- 
takes as input a <inputPoints.txt> which is a xyz text file 
it compute the fitting for this single entry and 
it outputs results in the <output.txt> file and on the standard std::cout

Usage is : Single_estimation <inputPoints.txt> <d_fitting>, <d_monge>" 

in_points are sampled on 0.1(x²+2y²)

./Single_estimation data/in_points_file.txt  2 2
./Single_estimation data/in_points_d4.txt  4 4
 

Program Mesh_estimation
-----------------
takes an filename.off file as input,
it computes a fitting for each vertex

it outputs the results in :
1. filename.off.4ogl.txt  which records raw data (better for a vizualization
   post-processing)
2. if option -vtrue, filename.off.verb.txt contains human readable results

Allowed options:
  -h [ --help ]                                   produce help message.
  -f [ --input-file ] arg (=data/ellipe0.003.off) name of the input off file
  -d [ --degree-jet ] arg (=2)                    degree of the jet
  -m [ --degree-monge ] arg (=2)                  degree of the Monge rep
  -a [ --nb-rings ] arg (=0)                      number of rings to collect 
                                                  neighbors. 0 means collect 
                                                  enough rings to make appro

                                                  rings to be collected
  -p [ --nb-points ] arg (=0)                     number of neighbors to use.  
                                                  0 means this option is not 
                                                  considered, this is the 
                                                  default p>=1 fixes the nb of 
                                                  points to be used
  -v [ --verbose ] arg (=0)                       verbose output on text file


Note : if the nb of collected points is less than the required min number of 
   points to make the approxiamtion possible (which is constrained by the deg)
   then the vertex is skipped.
