To compile, you need clapack : set env variable LAPACK_DIR


Program blind_1pt
--------------------- 
takes as input a <inputPoints.txt> which is a xyz text file 
it compute the fitting for this single entry and 
it outputs results in the <output.txt> file and on the standard std::cout

Usage is : main <inputPoints.txt> <output.txt> <d_fitting>, <d_monge>" 

in_points are sampled on 0.1(x²+2y²)

./blind_1pt data/in_points_file.txt output.txt 2 2
./blind_1pt data/in_points_d4.txt output.txt 4 4


Program blind
-----------------
takes an filename.off file as input,
it computes a fitting for each vertex

it outputs the results in :
1. filename.off.4ogl.txt  which can be visualized with 
	the demo program introspect-qt
2. if option -v, filename.off.verb.txt contains human readable results

Usage is : blind  with options    
    "f:fName <string>",	 // filename.off
    "d:deg <int>",	 // degree of the jet
    "m:mdegree <int>",	 // degree of the Monge rep
    "a:nrings <int>",	 // # rings 
			0 means collect enough rings to make appro possible
			k>=1 fixes the nb of rings to be collected
    "p:npoints <int>",   //# points
			0 means this option is not considered, this is the default
			n>=1 fixes the nb of points to be used
    "v|",                // verbose?
 
Note : if the nb of collected points is less than the required min number of 
   points to make the approxiamtion possible (which is constrained by the deg)
   then the vertex is skipped.

 ./blind -f data/ellipe0.003.off -d2 -m2 -a2 
 ./blind -f data/poly2x\^2+y\^2-0.062500-off -d2 -m2 -a2
