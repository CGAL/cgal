An Arithmetic_kernel is required to provide at least the following public types:
Integer, Rational, Bigfloat_interval. It is guranteed that these types are interoperable. Currently there are:
Gmp_arithmetic_kernel
CORE_arithmetic_kernel
LEDA_arithmetic_kernel

Moreover, the package provides a class template Get_arithmetic_kernel<T>. This cclass provides the corresponding Arithmetic_kernel for T. Note that T may also be a non trivial type such as Sqrt_extension, Polynomial etc.
