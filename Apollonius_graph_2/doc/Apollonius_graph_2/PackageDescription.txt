An Apollonius graph is the dual of the Apollonius diagram, also known
as the <I>additively weighted Voronoi diagram</I>. It is essentially the
Voronoi diagram of a set of disks, where the distance of a
point of the plane from a disk is defined as the Euclidean
distance of the point and the center of the circle, minus the radius
of the disk.

\cgal provides the class `CGAL::Apollonius_graph_2<Gt,Agds>` for
computing the 2D Apollonius graph. The two template parameters must be
models of the `ApolloniusGraphTraits_2` and
`ApolloniusGraphDataStructure_2` concepts. The first concept is
related to the geometric objects and predicates associated with
Apollonius graphs, whereas the second concept refers to the data
structure used to represent the Apollonius graph. The classes
`Apollonius_graph_traits_2<K,Method_tag>` and
`Triangulation_data_structure_2<Vb,Fb>` are models of the
aforementioned concepts.
