\defgroup sm_namedparameters Named Parameters for Subdivision Methods
\ingroup PkgSurfaceSubdivisionMethods3Ref

In this package, all functions optional parameters are implemented as BGL optional
named parameters (see \ref BGLNamedParameters for more information on how to use them).
Since the parameters of the various functions defined in this package are redundant,
their long descriptions are centralized below.
The sequence of named parameters should start with `CGAL::parameters::`.
`CGAL::parameters::all_default()` can be used to indicate
that default values of optional named parameters must be used.

In the following, we assume that the type `PolygonMesh` is passed as template
parameters of the functions, and is a model of the concept `MutableFaceGraph`.

The following named parameter, offered by the package \ref PkgBGL
(see \ref bgl_namedparameters), is used in this package:

\cgalNPTableBegin
\cgalNPBegin{vertex_point_map} \anchor SM_vertex_point_map
is the property map with the points associated to the vertices of the polygon mesh `pmesh`.\n
<b>Type:</b> a class model of `ReadablePropertyMap` with
`boost::graph_traits<PolygonMesh>::%vertex_descriptor` as key type and
`GeomTraits::Point_3` as value type. \n
<b>Default:</b> \code boost::get(CGAL::vertex_point, pmesh) \endcode
\cgalNPEnd
\cgalNPTableEnd

In addition to this named parameter, this package offers the following named parameter:

\cgalNPTableBegin
\cgalNPBegin{number_of_iterations} \anchor SM_number_of_iterations
is the number of subdivision steps.\n
<b>Type:</b> \c unsigned \c int \n
<b>Default:</b> `1`
\cgalNPEnd
\cgalNPTableEnd
