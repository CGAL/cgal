\defgroup obb_namedparameters Named Parameters for the package Optimal Bounding Box
\ingroup PkgOptimalBoundingBoxRef

In this package, all functions optional parameters are implemented as BGL optional
named parameters (see \ref BGLNamedParameters for more information on how to use them).
Since the parameters of the various functions defined in this package are redundant,
their long descriptions are centralized below.
The sequence of named parameters should start with `CGAL::parameters::`.
`CGAL::parameters::all_default()` can be used to indicate
that default values of optional named parameters must be used.

In the following, we assume that the following types are provided as template parameters
of functions and classes. Note that, for some of these functions,
the type is more specific:
<ul>
<li>`PolygonMesh` is a model of the concept `FaceGraph`</li>.
<li>`GeomTraits` a geometric traits class in which constructions are performed and
     predicates evaluated. Everywhere in this package, a \cgal `Kernel` fulfills the requirements.</li>
</ul>

The following named parameters, offered by the package \ref PkgBGL
(see \ref bgl_namedparameters), are used in this package:

\cgalNPTableBegin
\cgalNPBegin{vertex_point_map} \anchor OBB_vertex_point_map
is the property map with the points associated to the vertices of the polygon mesh `pmesh`.\n
<b>Type:</b> a class model of `ReadablePropertyMap` with
`boost::graph_traits<PolygonMesh>::%vertex_descriptor` as key type and
`GeomTraits::Point_3` as value type. \n
<b>Default:</b> \code boost::get(CGAL::vertex_point, pmesh) \endcode
\cgalNPEnd
\cgalNPTableEnd

In addition to these named parameters, this package offers the following named parameters:

\cgalNPTableBegin
\cgalNPBegin{geom_traits} \anchor OBB_geom_traits
is the geometric traits instance in which the mesh processing operation should be performed.\n
<b>Type:</b> a Geometric traits class.\n
<b>Default</b>:
\code typename CGAL::Kernel_traits<
        typename boost::property_traits<
          typename boost::property_map<PolygonMesh, CGAL::vertex_point_t>::type>::value_type>::Kernel \endcode
\cgalNPEnd

\cgalNPBegin{use_convex_hull} \anchor OBB_use_convex_hull
Parameter used in the construction of oriented bounding box to indicate whether the algorithm should
first extract the extreme points (points that are on the 3D convex hull) of the input data range
to accelerate the computation of the bounding box.
\n
\b Type : `bool` \n
\b Default value is `true`
\cgalNPEnd

\cgalNPTableEnd
