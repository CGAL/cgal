Stuff to look at, as time permits:
----------------------------------

- Why Ray_3 and Line_3 don't have the same internal representation ???

- Triangle-Triangle intersection (and predicate) :

    Graphics Tools, 2(2):25-30, 1997

- Remove all global function usage, and replace by common code for all kernels.
  The backward compatible layer could look like :

// Another idea : write a backward compatible wrapper for any kernel,
// say, Backward<R> using only the kernel traits R, and giving the additional
// interface to get an "old kernel interface" from it.
// So in particular, we would have :
template <class R>
Backward
{
  typedef CGAL::Point_2<Backward<R> > Point_2;
};
// Backward<R> would also be a valid kernel traits, but with
// R::Point_2 != Backward<R>::Point_2.
 
------------------------

- Tests :
  - Write a Checker for full kernels, like Pm_traits_checker.h ?
  - Advanced kernel, Cd.

- Handles :

    [16.22] How do I provide reference counting with copy-on-write
            semantics for a hierarchy of classes?
  - Having a proper Handle_for_virtual<> is becoming important...
    - It must have the same interface than Handle_for<> [due, it can't !]
    - Must use the allocator, see Stefan's mail. [due, impossible !]
    - Ok, after reflexion : it can't use STL allocators, however we can do
      something clean by looking at auto_ptr<>, I think.
    - It would also be nice if we could remove the ref-counting mechanism
      easily, like for Handle_for<>. [low priority, but would be nice to
      get the right interface able to do that]
      Update : it is not possible to have it since we cannot copy this object
      as we don't know its exact type !
    - Apply them to Aff_transformations, then Lazy_exact_nt<>, then... :)

- ::bbox() robustness issues : it's not robust, since basically, we use
  to_double().
  The homogeneous kernel uses an epsilon to get this right, in the case
  to_double() returns an error < 1 ulp().
  I would propose to use the intervals, and require the NTs to have a
  to_interval().  For most of the current ones, it's already done, so...
  Ask Stefan and the list about that.  For PointH2::bbox(), we would have:
{
  Interval_base x = CGAL::to_interval(hx());
  Interval_base y = CGAL::to_interval(hy());
  Interval_base w = CGAL::to_interval(hw());
  // The following can be slightly optimized using the advanced class.
  return Bbox_2(Interval_nt<>(x)/Interval_nt<>(w),
                Interval_nt<>(y)/Interval_nt<>(w));
}
  And PointC2::bbox():
{
  return Bbox_2(CGAL::to_interval(x()), CGAL::to_interval(y()));
}
- Merge Intersection package ?  What about Conic ?
- Cd must come back to life somehow...  Currently, I've disabled it ~totally
  in Cartesian.h.  Same thing for Conics...
- Homogeneous' Point_2 has member functions :
    // and for efficiency in the predicates:
    const RT&     hx_ref() const;
    const RT&     hy_ref() const;
    const RT&     hw_ref() const;
  Probably a good idea ?  Or is it worse with doubles ?  Let's try.
  Why do Point.x(), y(), hx(), hy(), hw() return FT instead of a "const FT &" ?
- include/CGAL/smallest_radiusC2.h should use the kernel code.
  Check if it's ok (correct and as efficient), and tell Frank to do so.
  The name of this file doesn't have anything to do with what is inside anyway.
- Herve complains that the design of the CGAL kernel is too
  cartesian/homogeneous oriented, whereas it could be made more general (think
  polar kernel).  Anyone with a concrete proposal ? :)
