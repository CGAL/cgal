\cgalPkgDesc{This package offers a surface reconstruction algorithm based on Delaunay triangulation, designed to work
with unstructured point clouds. It builds a watertight surface by merging balls centered at Voronoi vertices, which
approximate the medial axisof the shape. The algorithm uses a global variant of the ball merge strategy, making it robust
to typical issues in scanned data—such as noise, outliers, and small gaps. It’s especially suited for reconstructing clean,
closed surfaces from real-world 3D scans.}
