\cgalPkgDesc{The package provides a Delaunay triangulation based surface reconstruction algorithm from an unorganized point set. The reconstructed surface consists of the interface between Voronoi balls, which
approximate the interior and exterior medial balls. This package contains the so-called global variant of the ball merge algorithm,
which is carefully designed to reconstruct a watertight surface from real-world scanned data sets, exhibiting mild noise, outliers, and small gaps in the data.}
