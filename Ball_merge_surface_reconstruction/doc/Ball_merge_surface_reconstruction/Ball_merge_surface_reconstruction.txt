Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes from unstructured point sets is a classic problem in Computer Graphics and Computational
Geometry with applications in many domains, such as CAD, medical imaging, or visualization. Yet, the problem is ill-posed as multiple 
shapes can explain the same point sets - especially in the presence of outliers, noise, missing parts, or density variations.

The main idea behind \f$ BallMerge \f$ is to introduce an intuitive geometric criterion
to reconstruct a piece-wise linear approximation of a sampled surface. Although \f$ BallMerge \f$ does not provide topological guarantees
on the reconstruction other than watertightness, it achieves competitive quality to state-of-the-art methods in practice, as shown
via various challenging examples. Further, the solution is easy to implement, uses less memory, and is an order of magnitude
faster than competing work, which makes it very practical. \f$ BallMerge \f$ has two variants to address closed and open surfaces, respectively,
since they pose differing challenges: \f$ Global BallMerge \f$ which can be made automatic, guarantees a watertight surface and robustness
regarding sampling density, outliers, and a reasonable noise level, and is thus ideally suited to reconstruct entire scans (closed surfaces
that can contain holes). The second variant, called \f$ Local BallMerge \f$, reconstructs non-watertight surfaces well with the default parameter value, 
which is easily tunable to handle imperfections and handles even scans from various sensor types with strong noise and missing parts, so it targets open
surfaces from scans of, e.g., outdoor scenes.

\section secBMSRdefinitions Definitions

The detailed description of the algorithm can be seen in \cgalCite{poem24}.

The basic idea is built upon the fact that whenever a discrete set of sample points approximates a continuous surface, the Voronoi balls (interior/exterior) intersect along the boundary with a ratio inversely 
proportional to the sampling density (similar to the observation of Amenta et al. \cgalCite{ack-pcubm-01}). Based on this, we define an "intersection ratio" between adjacent Voronoi balls as follows:

\f$ ir(B_0,B_1) = max((r_0+r_1-d)/r_0,(r_0+r_1-d)/r_1) \f$

Where \f$ B_0 \f$ and \f$ B_1 \f$ are two adjacent Voronoi balls with radius \f$ r_0 \f$ and \f$ r_1 \f$ respectively, and \f$ d \f$ is the distance between it's circumcenters.

Using this ratio, we can say that, if the intersection ratio between two adjacent Voronoi balls is small, they likely correspond to a pair of interior and exterior balls sharing a thin overlapping region along the 
underlying surface (a 2D case is illustrated in Figure \cgalFigureRef{figBMSRillus}). In other words, given a threshold \f$ \delta \f$, a triangle is said to belong to a set \f$ BallMerge(\delta) \f$ if its corresponding adjacent Voronoi balls have an intersection ratio less than
\f$ \delta \f$. By definition, \f$ BallMerge(\delta) \f$ is a subcomplex of the Delaunay Triangulation of the sample points. It is easy to see that \f$ BallMerge(0) \f$ is empty, while \f$ BallMerge(\delta) \f$, for
any \f$ \delta \gt 2 \f$ contains all the triangles of the Delaunay Triangulation.

\subsection secGlobalBMSR Global BallMerge 

Given a threshold \f$ \delta \f$, two Delaunay simplices are called \f$ \delta\f$-merged either if their corresponding Voronoi balls are adjacent with an intersection ratio \f$ > \delta \f$ or if there exists another
Delaunay simplex, which is \f$ \delta\f$-merged with both of them. Following a procedure similar to classical connected component computation, the algorithm starts by visiting \f$ \delta\f$-merged simplices from an 
arbitrary seed simplex (the procedure is order independent) and tag them with the current component label until no more \f$ \delta\f$-merged simplices remain. The procedure is then restarted with any yet unvisited 
simplex until all have been visited, and output the simplices with the most frequent label. The reconstructed surface is then computed from the boundary of this output.

It is worth noting that \f$ Global BallMerge \f$ always results in a watertight surface (by definition) since it bounds a solid - even if it is not necessarily manifold. The effect of \f$ \delta \f$ is shown in Figure
\cgalFigureRef{figBMSRpartuning}. As it can be seen, a larger value of \f$ \delta \f$ removes necessary parts from the shape, while a smaller value of \f$ \delta \f$ adds unnecessary parts to the shape.

Although \f$ Global BallMerge\f$ algorithm is well suited for reconstructing watertight surfaces, many real-world scans represent non-watertight models due to extensive missing data and open surfaces - for example, 
in 2D (please note that the core idea of \f$ BallMerge \f$ works in both 2D and 3D), a set of points representing a shape with open curves and junctions is shown in Figure \cgalFigureRef{figBMSRlocalillus}. Though our method could successfully partition the Voronoi balls based on the intersection ratio,
we do not get the expected result using \f$ Global BallMerge\f$ as it outputs only a single connected component. Therefore, in this local variant of the \f$ BallMerge \f$ algorithm, for any two adjacent \f$d\f$-simplices, 
which are not \f$ \delta\f$-mergeable, the shared \f$(d − 1)\f$-simplex is retained. As expected and can be observed in our experiments, outliers and open surfaces result in very large simplices. Thus, we consider 
elements \f$ \delta\f$-mergeable only if the longest edge of the simplex is smaller than \f$ \frac{1}{\eta}*\beta \f$ (\f$ \eta \f$ is a scaling factor, \f$ \beta \f$ is the length of the bounding box diagonal) 
to remove large simplices (typical for open meshes).

In practice, the threshold \f$ \eta = 200\f$ was observed to perform well and can be adjusted - Figure \cgalFigureRef{figBMSRetatuning} shows the effect of varying \f$ \eta \f$.

\section secBMSRexamples Examples

Two functions `ball_merge_surface_reconstruction_global()` and `ball_merge_surface_reconstruction_local()` are provided to use \f$ GlobalBallMerge \f$ and \f$ LocalBallMerge \f$ functionalities.

`ball_merge_surface_reconstruction_global()` has the following arguments: The set of input points, two output parameters where the resulting meshes will be stored, and the parameter \f$ \delta \f$. The function
returns two meshes - the largest and second-largest components as sometimes the expected shape will be the second-largest component after merging. A sample program showing how to use this function is given below:

\cgalExample{Ball_merge_surface_reconstruction/ball_merge_reconstruction_global.cpp}

`ball_merge_surface_reconstruction_local()` has the following arguments: The set of input points, an output parameter where the resulting mesh will be stored, the parameter \f$ \delta \f$, and the parameter \f$ \eta 
\f$ (to prune unnecessary long triangles). A sample program showing how to use this function is given below:

\cgalExample{Ball_merge_surface_reconstruction/ball_merge_reconstruction_local.cpp}

Alternatively, these functions can be combined as in the following program where argv[1] is the filename, argv[2] is the parameter \f$ \delta \f$, argv[3] decides whether to use local (0) or global variant (1), and arg[4]
is an optional parameter \f$ \eta \f$ in case the user opts for the local variant.

\cgalExample{Ball_merge_surface_reconstruction/ball_merge_reconstruction.cpp}

Ideally, the current implementation takes a dense point cloud as input (plain x,y,z coordinates without any additional information like normal and texture) sampled over a smooth surface. Thanks to the "intersection
ratio", the algorithm can also handle a few challenging cases with mild noise, outliers or missing data up to an extent. It is worth noting that, while using \f$ GloablBallMerge \f$, outliers sometimes create deep 
cavities over the surface and increased amount of noise shrinks and sometimes miss important features.

Finally, the algorithm is lightweight and requires only a little computation in terms of input size as it performs only two quick linear-time passes on the Delaunay complex (global), or just a single pass (local).
