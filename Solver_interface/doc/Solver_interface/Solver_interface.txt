Several \cgal packages have to solve linear systems with dense or
sparse matrices. This package provides concepts and models for that
purpose.

We generally provide models using the \ref thirdpartyEigen
library. Wrappers for the Eigen classes `Eigen_matrix` and
`Eigen_vector` are also provided when needed.

It is straightforward to develop equivalent models for
other solvers, for example those found in the <a
href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl">Intel Math Kernel
Library (MKL)</a>.


\section SectionSolverDiagonalize Matrix Diagonalization

The concept `DiagonalizeTraits<T,dim>` defines an interface for the
diagonalization and computation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a
symmetric matrix. `T` is the number type and `dim` is the dimension of
the matrices and vector (set to 3 by default). We provide two models
for this concept:

- `Eigen_diagonalize_traits<T,dim>` uses the \ref thirdpartyEigen library.
- `Diagonalize_traits<T,dim>` is an internal implementation that does not
depend on another library.

Although both models achieve the same computation,
`Eigen_diagonalize_traits<T,dim>` is faster and should thus be used if the
\ref thirdpartyEigen library is available. The eigenvalues are stored
in ascending order and eigenvectors are stored in accordance.

This is an example of an eigen decomposition of a matrix using this
class:


\cgalExample{Solver_interface/diagonalize_matrix.cpp}


\section SectionSolverSVD Singular Value Decomposition

The concept `SvdTraits` defines an interface for solving in the least
square sense a linear system with a singular value decomposition. The
field type is `double`. We provide the model `Eigen_svd` that uses the
\ref thirdpartyEigen library.

Here is a simple example that shows how to handle matrices, vectors
and this solver:

\cgalExample{Solver_interface/singular_value_decomposition.cpp}




\section SectionSolverSparse Sparse Solvers

We define 3 concepts for sparse linear algebra:

- `SparseLinearAlgebraTraits_d`
- `SparseLinearAlgebraWithFactorTraits_d`
- `NormalEquationSparseLinearAlgebraTraits_d`

An interface to the sparse solvers from the \ref thirdpartyEigen
library is provided as a model for these 3 concepts through the class
`Eigen_solver_traits<T>`. This solver traits class can be used for an
iterative or a direct, symmetric or general sparse solvers. The
specific solver to be used must be given as template parameter.

Each \cgal package using a sparse solver specifies which type of matrix
and solver is required:

\code{.cpp} 

typedef CGAL::Eigen_sparse_matrix<double>::EigenType EigenMatrix; 

//iterative general solver 
typedef CGAL::Eigen_solver_traits< Eigen::BiCGSTAB<EigenMatrix> > Iterative_general_solver; 

//iterative symmetric solver 
typedef CGAL::Eigen_solver_traits< Eigen::ConjugateGradient<EigenMatrix> > Iterative_symmetric_solver; 

//direct symmetric solver 
typedef CGAL::Eigen_solver_traits< Eigen::SimplicialCholesky<EigenMatrix> > Direct_symmetric_solver; 

\endcode

Here is an example that shows how to fill the sparse matrix and call
the solver:

\section SolversHistory Implementation History
This package is the result of the increasing needs for linear solvers
in \cgal.  The first packages that introduced the solver concepts were
\ref PkgSurfaceParameterization, \ref PkgPoissonSurfaceReconstruction
and \ref PkgJet_fitting_3.  At that time, these packages were relying
on \sc{Taucs}, \sc{LAPACK}, \sc{BLAS} and \sc{OpenNL}. Gaël Guennebaud
then introduced new models using the \ref thirdpartyEigen library that
became the only supported models by \cgal.  Later on the packages \ref
PkgMeanCurvatureSkeleton3Summary and \ref PkgSurfaceMeshDeformationSummary
extended the existing concepts.

Simon Giraudot was responsible for gathering all concepts and classes, and also wrote this user manual
with the help of Andreas Fabri.
