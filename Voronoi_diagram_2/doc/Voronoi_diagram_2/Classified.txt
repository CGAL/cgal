\cgal provides the class `CGAL::Voronoi_diagram_2<DG,AT,AP>` for
adapting the various (triangulated) Delaunay graphs to Voronoi
diagrams according to some adaptation policy.
In particular, the class `CGAL::Voronoi_diagram_2<DG,AT,AP>`
provides an API for the duals of (triangulated) Delaunay graphs, that
makes them look like planar subdivisions. The adaptation policy is
responsible for deciding which edges and faces of these duals should
be eliminated. This is especially important when, for instance, we
want to eliminate degenerate features in the Voronoi diagram that are
the result of the fact that Delaunay graphs are always triangulated
and are due to degenerate configurations in the generating data.

The three template parameters must be models of the
`DelaunayGraph_2`, `AdaptationTraits_2` and
`AdaptationPolicy_2` concepts, respectively.
The first concept is related to the Delaunay graphs that are to be
adapted, whereas the second one is responsible for
manipulating/accessing in a unified way the geometry of a specific
Voronoi diagram as well as for performing nearest site queries. 
The third template parameter corresponds to the chosen adaptation
policy and provides the necessary types and functors needed for
performing this adaptation.
