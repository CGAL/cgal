   The source code of the CGAL library can be found in the directories
   "src/CGAL", "src/CGALQt", "src/CGALQt4" and "include/CGAL" (with the

   It is specified in each file of the CGAL library which
   license applies to it. This is either the GNU General Public License

   version). The texts of both licenses can be found in the files LICENSE.GPL
   and LICENSE.LGPL.

   exact license text can be found in the file LICENSE.FREE_USE.
