README.Debian
-------------

The homepage of CGAL (https://www.cgal.org/) offers more information about CGAL.
In particular, a mailing list and the documentation for the library (in PDF and
HTML) are available. The authors ask you to give some feedback about your usage
of CGAL in a short questionnaire (in the download section).


Documentation
-------------

Note that the CGAL documentation cannot be packaged for Debian due to unclear
license conditions. The complete documentation in PDF and HTML is available at
https://www.cgal.org/.


Demos and examples
------------------

Tarballs with demos and examples can be found in /usr/share/doc/libcgal-demo.
Extract the tarballs somewhere and call "cmake ." to configure the
demos/examples. Call "make" to build them, either in the top-level directory
to build all demos/examples (which takes some time and needs quite some disk
space), or in the subdirectory of the desired demo/example. The cmake option
-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON is useful to generate verbose makefiles that show
each executed command.


Demos using libQGLViewer
------------------------

The Debian package of libQGLViewer uses non-standard library names to offer the
library in a Qt3 and Qt4 flavor. The build system of CGAL has been patched to
handle the non-standard library name. If your libQGLViewer packages are older
than 2.3.1-4 you need to work around another problem with the non-standard
include directory. Create an include directory with the expected name
"QGLViewer", e.g.,

  mkdir -p /some/dir
  ln -s /usr/include/qglviewer-qt4 /some/dir/QGLViewer

and pass the option

  -DQGLVIEWER_INCLUDE_DIR=/some/dir

to cmake. See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=522659 for more
information.
