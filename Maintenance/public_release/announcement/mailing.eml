Body:

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the recent releases
of CGAL versions 5.5.5, 5.6.2, 6.0, and 6.0.1.

## CGAL version 6.0

CGAL version 6.0 was released on September 27, 2024. Following the
discovery of early issues, version 6.0.1 was subsequently released on
October 22, 2024.

This version is a major release, with many new features and
improvements.

General changes

-   C++17 Requirement: CGAL 6.0 requires a C++17 compatible compiler.
-   GMP/MPFR Optional: GMP/MPFR are no longer mandatory;
    Boost.Multiprecision can be used.
-   Qt6 Demos: All demos are now based on Qt6.
-   Polyhedral Surface: The demo has been renamed to “CGAL Lab” and
    moved to its own directory in demo/Lab/.

New Packages

-   Kinetic Space Partition: Partition of the space from planar input
    shapes.
-   Kinetic Surface Reconstruction: Reconstructs surfaces from point
    clouds.
-   Basic Viewer: Interactive visualization for various CGAL packages.
-   Polygon Repair: Algorithms to repair 2D polygons and multipolygons.

Breaking Changes

-   CMake Changes: UseCGAL.cmake removed; use CGAL::CGAL target instead.
-   Kernel: Replaced boost::variant with std::variant and
    boost::optional with std::optional in the intersection functions.

Enhancements

-   AABB Tree: Now supports 2D and 3D primitives.

## Bug-fix releases

-   CGAL version 5.5.5 has been published. This is the last bug-fix
    release for CGAL-5.5.
-   CGAL version 5.6.2 has been published. This is the second bug-fix
    release for CGAL-5.6.

These releases include various bug fixes and enhancements. For more details,

The development of CGAL will now focus on the upcoming CGAL-6.1 release,
planned for late 2025. Bug fixes will continue to be backported to the
CGAL-5.6.x and CGAL-6.0.x branches.


The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations, Delaunay triangulations
  and periodic triangulations in 2D and 3D),
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- regularized Boolean operations on polygons with curved arcs
- arrangements of curves,
- mesh generation (2D, 3D and surface mesh generation,
  surface mesh subdivision and parametrization),
- alpha shapes (in 2D and 3D),
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD),
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon),
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and
  range and segment trees),
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of
  streamlines),
- optimization algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal
  component analysis).
