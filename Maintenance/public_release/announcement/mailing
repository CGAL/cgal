Subject: CGAL 3.0 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body: 

We are pleased to announce the release 3.0 of CGAL, the Computational Geometry
Algorithms Library.  Version 3.0 differs from version 2.4 in licensing, in the
platforms that are supported and in functionality.

The license has been changed to either the LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public
License v2.1) or the QPL (Q Public License v1.0) depending on each package.
So CGAL remains free of use for you, if your usage meets the criteria of
these licenses, otherwise, a commercial license has to be purchased from
Geometry Factory (www.geometryfactory.com).

Major changes in this release include the following:

o Apollonius graph: the dual of the Voronoi diagram of a set of circles under
  the Euclidean metric.  The implementation is dynamic.

o Min_sphere_of_spheres_d: Algorithms to compute the smallest enclosing sphere
  of a given set of spheres in d-dimensional space.

o Spatial Searching: Provides exact and approximate distance browsing in a set
  of points in d-dimensional space (such as nearest neighbor searching).

o Largest_empty_iso_rectangle_2: Given a set of points P in the plane,
  computes the largest empty iso-rectangle that are inside a given
  iso-rectangle bounding box, and that do not contain any point of P.

o Interval_skip_list: A data strucure for finding all intervals in R that
  contain a value, and for stabbing queries, that is for answering the
  question whether a given value is contained in an interval or not.

o Existing packages have been improved in various area:
  2D and 3D triangulations, Planar Maps, Arrangements...

o The CORE library (http://www.cs.nyu.edu/exact/core/) for exact computations
  is now distributed as part of CGAL as well.

o We support the latest versions of the C++ compilers from GNU, Microsoft,
  Intel, Sun, SGI.

o All demos are now using the portable Qt window toolkit.

See http://www.cgal.org/releases_frame.html for a complete list of changes.


The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data 
structures and algorithms. The CGAL library contains:
o Basic geometric primitives such as points, vectors, lines, predicates
  for testing things such as relative positions of points, and operations
  such as intersections and distance calculation.
o A collection of standard data structures and geometric algorithms, 
  such as convex hull, (Delaunay, Regular, Constrained) triangulation, Voronoi
  diagrams, planar map, arrangements, polyhedron, smallest enclosing sphere,
  multidimensional query structures...
o Interfaces to other packages, e.g. for visualization, and I/O, and 
  other support facilities.
