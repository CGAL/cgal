Subject: CGAL 3.2 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body: 

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 3.2 of 
CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.  


Besides improvements of existing packages this release offers
the following new algorithms and data structures.

 o 2D Regularized Boolean Set-Operations

   This package consists of the implementation of Boolean
   set-operations on point sets bounded by weakly x-monotone curves in
   2-dimensional Euclidean space. In particular, it contains the
   implementation of regularized Boolean set-operations, intersection
   predicates, and point containment predicates.

 o 2D Straight Skeleton and Polygon Offsetting

   This package implements an algorithm to construct a halfedge data
   structure representing the straight skeleton in the interior of 2D
   polygons with holes and an algorithm to construct inward offset
   polygons at any offset distance given a straight skeleton.
   
   
 o 2D Voronoi Diagram

   The 2D Voronoi diagram package provides an adaptor that adapts a
   2-dimensional triangulated Delaunay graph to the corresponding
   Voronoi diagram, represented as a doubly connected edge list (DCEL)
   data structure. The adaptor has the ability to automatically
   eliminate, in a consistent manner, degenerate features of the 
   Voronoi diagram, that are artifacts of the requirement that 
   Delaunay graphs should be triangulated even in degenerate 
   configurations. Depending on the type of operations that the 
   underlying Delaunay graph supports, the adaptor allows for the 
   incremental or dynamic construction of Voronoi diagrams and can 
   support point location queries.


 o 3D Surface Mesher

   This package provides functions to generate surface meshes that
   interpolate smooth surfaces. The meshing algorithm is based on
   Delaunay refinement and provides some guarantees on the resulting
   mesh: the user is able to control the size and shape of the mesh
   elements and the accuracy of the surface approximation. There is no
   restriction on the topology and number of components of input
   surfaces. The surface mesher may also be used for non smooth 
   surfaces but without guarantee.

   Currently, implementations are provided for implicit surfaces
   described as the zero level set of some function and surfaces
   described as a gray level set in a three-dimensional image.


 o 3D Surface Subdivision Methods

   Subdivision methods recursively refine a control mesh and generate
   points approximating the limit surface. This package consists of 
   four popular subdivision methods and their refinement hosts. 
   Supported subdivision methods include Catmull-Clark, Loop, Doo-Sabin 
   and sqrt(3) subdivisions. Their respective refinement hosts are 
   PQQ, PTQ, DQQ and sqrt(3) refinements. Variations of those methods 
   can be easily extended by substituting the geometry computation of
   the refinement host.


 o Planar Parameterization of Triangulated Surface Meshes

   Parameterizing a surface amounts to finding a one-to-one mapping 
   from a suitable domain to the surface. In this package, we focus 
   on triangulated surfaces that are homeomorphic to a disk and on 
   piecewise linear mappings into a planar domain. This package 
   implements some of the state-of-the-art surface mesh 
   parameterization methods, such as least squares conformal maps, 
   discrete conformal map, discrete authalic parameterization, 
   Floater mean value coordinates or Tutte barycentric mapping.


 o Principal Component Analysis

   This package provides functions to compute global informations on 
   the shape of a set of 2D or 3D objects such as points. It provides 
   the computation of axis-aligned bounding boxes, centroids of point 
   sets, barycenters of weighted point sets, as well as linear least 
   squares fitting for point sets in 2D, and point sets as well as 
   triangle sets in 3D.


 o 2D Placement of Streamlines
   
   Visualizing vector fields is important for many application domains. 
   A good way to do it is to generate streamlines that describe the 
   flow behavior. This package implements the "Farthest Point Seeding"
   algorithm for placing streamlines in 2D vector fields. It generates 
   a list of streamlines corresponding to an input flow using a 
   specified separating distance. The algorithm uses a Delaunay 
   triangulation to model objects and adress different queries, and 
   relies on choosing the centers of the biggest empty circles to start 
   the integration of the streamlines.


 o  Kinetic Data Structures

   Kinetic data structures allow combinatorial structures to be
   maintained as the primitives move. The package provides
   implementations of kinetic data structures for Delaunay 
   triangulations in two and three dimensions, sorting of points in 
   one dimension and regular triangulations in three dimensions. 
   The package supports exact or inexact operations on primitives 
   which move along polynomial trajectories.


 o Kinetic Framework

   Kinetic data structures allow combinatorial geometric structures 
   to be maintained as the primitives move. The package provides a 
   framework to ease implementing and debugging kinetic data 
   structures. The package supports exact or inexact operations on 
   primitives which move along polynomial trajectories.


 o  Smallest Enclosing Ellipsoid 
   
   An approximative algorithm for constructing the smallest enclosing 
   ellipsoid in d-dimensional Euclidean space.

The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like 
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations and Delaunay 
  triangulations in 2D and 3D), 
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted 
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- arrangements of curves, 
- mesh algorithms (2D Delaunay mesh generation and 3D surface mesh 
  generation, surface mesh subdivision and parameterization), 
- alpha shapes, 
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD), 
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon), 
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and 
  range and segment trees), 
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of 
  streamlines), 
- optimisation algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or 
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal 
  component analysis), 
- kinetic data structures.
