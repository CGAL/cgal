\defgroup PkgPointSet3IO Input/Output
\ingroup PkgPointSet3Ref

\brief This module offers convenience overloads of input/ouput
functions available in the \ref PkgPointSetProcessingSummary package.
These overloads, available after including `CGAL/Point_set_3/IO.h`,
allow the user to call point set processing algorithms without having
to handle manually property maps and iterators.

Input functions instanciate all the necessary property maps:

- if found in the input, normal vectors are stored in the usual
`CGAL::Point_set_3` property `normal` with template type `Vector`

- for PLY and LAS input, other properties are stored as properties in
the `CGAL::Point_set_3` class with the name and type given by the PLY
header or by the LAS standard.

For a complete documentation of these functions, please refer to the
\ref PkgPointSetProcessingRef manual.
