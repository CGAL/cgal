\section Point_set_3_Principle General Principle

There exists many sensors that generate 3D point sets: laser scanners,
LIDAR devices, cameras with photogrammetry post-processing... \cgal
provides several algorithms to process such point sets (see
\ref Chapter_Point_Set_Processing "Point Set Processing",
\ref Chapter_Point_Set_Shape_Detection "Shape Detection",
\ref Chapter_Advancing_Front_Surface_Reconstruction "Surface Reconstruction", etc.).

While these algorithms do not impose specific data structures to work
on, \cgal provides a 3D point set structure to make it easier for the
user to handle additional properties (such as normal vectors, colors,
labels...) and to call \cgal algorithms on them.

`CGAL::Point_set_3<Gt>` is a vector based data structure that
contains, by default, only 2 properties:

- The _point_ property (with `CGAL::Point_3<Gt>` type)

- The _index_ property (with `std::size_t` type) used to easily change
the order of the points without having to move all the properties.

Any property the user needs can be easily added, modified and
removed. A property is identified by a unique name and a
type. Convenience methods are provided to handle the property _normal_
of type `CGAL::Vector_3<Gt>` that is a very common property on point
sets.

Reordering is only done by swapping index values: this guarantees that
these operations have a constant complexity no matter how many
properties are defined. To avoid frequent memory allocation and
deallocation, removal of points is also handled by swapping the index
values, putting the points marked as removed at the back of the index
property and keeping track of the number of points marked as
removed. If the user needs memory to be disallocated, the element
marked as removed can be actually deleted from memory.

\section Point_set_3_Usage Simple Usage

The data structure is designed to be easy to use despite its potential
complexity when using properties. Several convenience methods are
provided to handle points and normals without having to handle
properties directly.

The following example shows how to fill a point set with points, add a
normal property, set the normal values, add or remove an item, etc.

\cgalExample{Point_set_3/point_set.cpp}

\section Point_set_3_Properties Using Additional Properties

Every information in the point set is a property. A raw point set
comes with _index_ and _point_ properties. As we saw in the previous
section, the user can easily add a _normal_ property. But this
mechanism is generalized to any type of property.

The following example shows how to define a color property and an
intensity property, and how to modify the point set according to this.

\cgalExample{Point_set_3/point_set_property.cpp}

\section Point_set_3_Algorithms Applying CGAL Algorithms

Most \cgal algorithms let the user free to choose whatever data
structures he/she needs: the points and attributes are then access
through iterators and property maps. The `CGAL::Point_set_3<Gt>`
structure directly provides these iterators and property maps so that
applying \cgal algorithms to it is straightforward.

\subsection Point_set_3_PSP Point Set Processing

When adding a new property to the point set, the associated property
map is returned and can then be used as a standard property map. For
points and normals, the property maps can recovered using the methods
`point_map()` and `normal_map()`.

The following example shows how to apply some algorithms from the
\cgal library using a point set object:

- generating a point set around a sphere

- estimating the normals with `CGAL::jet_estimate_normals()`

- simplifying the point set with `CGAL::grid_simplify_point_set()`

- detecting the sphere shape with `CGAL::Shape_detection_3::Efficient_RANSAC`

\cgalExample{Point_set_3/point_set_algo.cpp}


\subsection Point_set_3_IO Input/Output

Using functions of \cgal to read files requires a slightly different
behavior because, internally, the properties of an item are defined
_before_ this item is inserted in the point set (which is not possible
with `CGAL::Point_set_3<Gt>`). We provide specific back inserters and
property maps:

- `CGAL::Point_set_3::index_back_inserter()` is used as an output iterator that creates
new item

- `CGAL::Point_set_3::point_push_map()` is a property map that is allowed to create a
new item if it was not yet created by the back inserter

- `CGAL::Point_set_3::normal_push_map()` works similarly

Such _push property maps_ are also available for other user-defined
properties (see `CGAL::Point_set_3::push_map()`).

The following example shows how to read a point set in the XYZ format
(it also normalizes and inverses the normal vectors and write the
result in the OFF format).

\cgalExample{Point_set_3/point_set_read_xyz.cpp}

The PLY number is the usual choice when storing an arbitrary number of
additional properties of points is needed. \cgal provides a function
`read_ply_custom_points()` that allows the user to recover any PLY
property he/she wants, provided the adapted PLY interpreter is
implemented.

An specific interpreter is provided to fill a `CGAL::Point_set_3`
object with all readable properties of a PLY input. Each PLY property
is read and stored on a point set property with the same name and same
type.

For example, if the following line is found in the PLY header:

> property uchar red

Then a property named _red_ and with type `boost::uint8_t` (`boost`
types are used because of their fixed memory size) will be
instanciated in the point set and filled with the corresponding
values.

Only points and normals are recovered as properties with complex class
types (namely `CGAL::Point_3` and `CGAL::Vector_3`). Other properties
are stored with simple number types. For example, if a color is given
with integer red, green and blue values, 3 integer properties _red_,
_green_ and _blue_ will be instanciated. A user-defined interpreter
must be implemented if such properties should be stored all together
(a unique property _color_ of type `CGAL::cpp11::array` for example).

The following example shows how to use this interpreter and how to
recover a specific property afterwards:

\cgalExample{Point_set_3/point_set_read_ply.cpp}


\section Point_set_3_History History

This package has been created to fill the need for a practical data
structure that handles points with a user-defined set of
properties. This property behavior was already implemented in the
\ref Chapter_3D_Surface_mesh "Surface Mesh" package: all the classes
dedicated to the management of properties were extracted so that they
can be used in this _3D Point Set_ package. `CGAL::Surface_mesh<P>`
and `CGAL::Point_set_3<P>` follow a similar API for property
management.
