\cgalConcept

The concept `TriangulationDataStructure_2` describes the requirements for
the second template parameter of the basic triangulation class
`Triangulation_2<Traits,Tds>` and of all other 2D triangulation classes.

The concept can be seen as a container for the
faces and vertices of the triangulation.
The concept `TriangulationDataStructure_2` includes two sub-concepts
`TriangulationDataStructure_2::Vertex` and
`TriangulationDataStructure_2::Face`.

The `TriangulationDataStructure_2`
maintains incidence and adjacency relations
among vertices and faces.

Each triangular face gives access to its three incident vertices
and to its three adjacent faces.
Each vertex gives access to one of its incident faces
and through that face to the circular list of its incident faces.

The three vertices of a face are indexed with 0, 1, and 2.
The neighbors of a face are also
indexed with 0, 1, and 2 in such a way that the neighbor indexed by `i`
is opposite to the vertex with the same index.

Each edge has two implicit representations : the edge
of a face `f` which is opposed to the vertex indexed `i`,
can be represented as well as an edge of the `neighbor(i)` of
`f`. See \cgalFigureRef{TDS_2D_Fig_neighbors1}.

The triangulation data structure
is responsible for the combinatorial integrity of the triangulation.
This means that the triangulation data structure
allows to perform some combinatorial operations
on the triangulation and guarantees the maintenance on
proper incidence and adjacency relations among the vertices
and faces. The term combinatorial operations
means that those operations are purely topological
and do not depend on the geometric embedding.
Insertion of a new vertex in a given face, or in a given edge,
suppression of a vertex of degree three, flip of two edges
are examples of combinatorial operations.

\cgalHeading{I/O}

The information output in the `iostream` is:
the dimension, the number of (finite) vertices,
the number of (finite) faces.
Then comes
for each vertex, the non combinatorial information stored in that vertex
if any.
Then comes
for each faces, the indices of its vertices and
the non combinatorial information (if any) stored in this face.
Then comes
for each face again
the indices of the neighboring faces.
The index of an item (vertex of face)
the rank of this item in the output order.
When dimension \f$ <\f$ 2, the same information is output
for faces of maximal dimension instead of faces.

\cgalConcept

The concept `TriangulationDataStructure_2::Face` describes the types used to store the faces
face class of a
`TriangulationDataStructure_2`.
A `TriangulationDataStructure_2::Face` stores three handles to its three vertices
and three handles to its three neighbors.
The vertices are indexed 0,1, and 2 in counterclockwise order.
The neighbor indexed `i` lies
opposite to vertex `i`.

In degenerate cases,
when the triangulation data structure stores a
simplicial complex of dimension `0` and `1`,
the type `TriangulationDataStructure_2::Face` is used to store the faces
of maximal dimension of the complex, i.e., a vertex in dimension `0`, an edge in dimension `1`.
Only vertices and neighbors with index `0` are set in the first case,
only vertices and neighbors with index `0` or `1` are set in the second case.

\cgalHeading{Types}

The class `TriangulationDataStructure_2::Face` defines the same types as
the triangulation data structure
except the iterators and the circulators.

\cgalHeading{Creation}

The methods `create_face()` and
`delete_face()`
have to be used to
define new faces and to delete no longer used faces.

Various algorithms using a triangulation data structure, such as Delaunay triangulations
or Alpha Shapes, must be able to associate a state to a face elemental.
For efficiency, this information must be stored directly within the face.

This class is only meant to store a state (Boolean). Consequently, the state must be the default
value (i.e. `false`) unless a setting function (`mark_in_conflict()`, etc.) has been called.

The three states are "in conflict", "on boundary", and "processed".
By default, a face is not in conflict, not on boundary, and not processed.
