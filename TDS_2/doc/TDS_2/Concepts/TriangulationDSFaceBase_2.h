\cgalRefines `TriangulationDataStructure_2::Face`

The concept `TriangulationDSFaceBase_2` describes the requirements for
the face base class of a `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2<Vb,Fb>`.

Note that if the `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2`
is plugged into a triangulation class,
the face base class may have additional geometric
requirements depending on the triangulation class.

At the base level,
(see Sections \ref Section_2D_Triangulations_Software_Design
and \ref TDS_2D_default ),
a face stores handles
on its three vertices and on the three neighboring faces.
The vertices and neighbors are indexed 0,1 and 2.
Neighbor `i` lies opposite to vertex `i`.

Since the `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2` is the class
which defines the handle
types, the face base class has to be somehow
parameterized by the triangulation
data structure. But since the `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2`
itself is parameterized by the face and vertex
base classes, there is a cycle in the definition of these classes.
In order
to break the cycle, the base classes for faces and vertices
which are plugged in to instantiate a
`CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2`
use  `void` as triangulation
data structure parameter. Then,
the `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2`
uses a <I>rebind</I> mechanism (similar to the one specified in
`std::allocator`) in order to plug itself
as parameter in the face and vertex base classes.
This mechanism requires that the base class provides
a templated nested class `Rebind_TDS` that
itself provides
the subtype `Rebind_TDS::Other`
which is the <I>rebound</I> version of the base class.
This <I>rebound</I> base class is the class
that the `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2`
actually uses as a base class for the class
`CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2::Face`.
