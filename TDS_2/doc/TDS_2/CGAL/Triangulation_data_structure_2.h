\ingroup PkgTDS2Ref

The class `Triangulation_data_structure_2` is a model
for the `TriangulationDataStructure_2` concept.
It can be used to represent an orientable 2D triangulation
embedded in a space of any dimension.

The vertices and faces are stored in two nested containers, which are
implemented using `Compact_container`. The class may offer some
flexibility for the choice of container in the future, in the form of
additional template parameters.

\tparam VertexBase must be a model of `TriangulationDSVertexBase_2`. The default is `Triangulation_ds_vertex_base_2<TDS>`.

\tparam FaceBase  must be a model of `TriangulationDSFaceBase_2`. The default is `Triangulation_ds_face_base_2<TDS>`.

\cgalHeading{Modifiers}

In addition to the modifiers required by the
`TriangulationDataStructure_2` concept, the `Triangulation_data_structure_2` class
supports also the modifiers below. Note also that the modifiers below
guarantee the combinatorial validity of the resulting data structure.
