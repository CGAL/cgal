\ingroup PkgKernelDKernels

A model for `Kernel_d` that uses %Cartesian coordinates to represent the
geometric objects.

This kernel is default constructible and copyable. It does not carry any
state so it is possible to use objects created by one instance with
functors created by another one.

This kernel supports construction of points from `double`
%Cartesian coordinates. It provides exact geometric predicates, but
the geometric constructions are not guaranteed to be exact. The geometric
predicates are made exact without sacrificing speed thanks to the use of
filters.

\tparam DimensionTag is a tag representing the dimension of the
ambient Euclidean space. It may be either `Dimension_tag<d>` where `d` is
an integer
or `Dynamic_dimension_tag`. In the latter case, the dimension of the space is specified for each point when it is constructed, so it does not need to be known at compile-time.


\attention Only the interfaces specific to this class are listed below. Refer to the
concepts for the rest.

\attention Known bugs: the functor `Kernel_d::Intersect_d` is not yet implemented. `Kernel_d::Contained_in_affine_hull` assumes that the iterators refer to an affinely independent family. `Kernel_d::Orientation_d` only works for points, not vectors.

\attention This kernel requires the \ref thirdpartyEigen "Eigen" library.
