\ingroup PkgKernelDKernels

A model for `Kernel_d`, minus `Kernel_d::Point_of_sphere_d`, that uses %Cartesian coordinates to represent the
geometric objects.

This kernel is default constructible and copyable. It does not carry any
state so it is possible to use objects created by one instance with
functors created by another one.

This kernel supports construction of points from `double` %Cartesian
coordinates. It provides exact geometric predicates and constructions. The
geometric predicates are made exact without sacrificing speed thanks to the use
of filters. The geometric constructions are made exact without sacrificing
speed thanks to a lazy mechanism, similar to
`Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel`. A construction creates an
approximate object, and stores a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the operation
and arguments used. When an operation needs more precision on an object than is
currently available, which should be rare, \cgal reconstructs exactly all the
ancestors of the object and replaces this part of the graph with exact objects.
This should be transparent for users, those details do not affect the
functionality, but they can cause surprising running time where the costly part
of an algorithm is not the construction itself, but a seemingly trivial use
afterwards that causes exact reconstruction of a large part of the structure.

`Sphere_d` is represented internally with a center and a squared radius, and the exact type used by the kernel is a rational type. This means that `Kernel_d::Point_of_sphere_d` cannot be implemented exactly in dimensions up to 3 (higher dimensions would require a decomposition of an integer as a sum of `d` squares), so currently it is not provided at all.

\tparam DimensionTag is a tag representing the dimension of the
ambient Euclidean space. It may be either `Dimension_tag<d>` where `d` is
an integer
or `Dynamic_dimension_tag`. In the latter case, the dimension of the space is specified for each point when it is constructed, so it does not need to be known at compile-time.


\attention Only the interfaces specific to this class are listed below. Refer to the
concepts for the rest.

\attention Known bugs: the functor `Kernel_d::Intersect_d` is not yet implemented. `Kernel_d::Contained_in_affine_hull` assumes that the iterators refer to an affinely independent family. `Kernel_d::Orientation_d` only works for points, not vectors. Visual Studio 2015 is not supported.

\attention This kernel requires the \ref thirdpartyEigen "Eigen" library.
