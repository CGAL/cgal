\section Shape_Regularization_Intro Introduction

This \cgal package enables to regularize a set of segments and open or closed contours in 2D
and a set of planes in 3D such that all input objects are rotated and aligned with respect
to the user-specified conditions. In addition, we provide a global regularization framework that can
be adjusted for the user needs and any type of geometric objects. This package can also be used
in conjunction with the \ref PkgShapeDetection "Shape Detection" package.


\section QP_Regularization_Segments Segments

Given a set of unordered 2D segments, users can reinforce three types of regularities
among these segments:
- *Parallelism*: segments, which are detected as near parallel, are made exactly parallel.
- *Orthogonality*: segments, which are detected as near orthogonal, are made exactly orthogonal.
- *Collinearity*: parallel segments, which are detected as near collinear, are made exactly collinear.

A typical use of this algorithm consists of the following steps:
1. Create an input range with 2D segments;
2. Define groups of segments, which should be regularized together;
3. Instantiate models of the concepts `NeighborQuery` and `RegularizationType` with the proper parameters;
4. Call the function `regularize_segments()`.

Once the user has defined an input range with 2D segments, he can either provide them all
to the regularization algorithm, which is the default option, or they could be reorganized into
groups of contextually similar segments. For example, all segments of the same length could
form a group. When regularizing, only segments within the group are taken into account, that
is no segment from one group will be oriented and/or aligned towards a segment from another group
(see more details \ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Delaunay "here").

To apply the algorithm, the user has to define two models: one of the concept `NeighborQuery` that provides
an access to the closest neighbors of a segment; and the other one of the concept `RegularizationType`
that provides one of the available regularities, which should be adjusted.

This \cgal component provides a model of the `NeighborQuery` concept:

- `Segments::Delaunay_neighbor_query_2` - finds local neighbors
of each segment by constructing a Delaunay triangulation. See more details
\ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Delaunay "here".

And two models of the `RegularizationType` concept:

- `Segments::Angle_regularization_2` - orients segments
to reinforce parallelism and orthogonality among them. See more details
\ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Angles "here".
- `Segments::Offset_regularization_2` - aligns parallel segments
to reinforce collinearity among them. See more details
\ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Offset "here".

The standard way to regularize a set of input segments is to first apply an angle regularization
and then an offset regularization, however the algorithm is flexible to handle other scenarios
as you will see later.

\note The core of this algorithm is the \ref QP_Regularization framework. For more details, please
refer to that section.

The example below shows the most straightforward entry point to the algorithm, where
we apply two type of regularities: parallelism and orthogonality, within the
group of all input segments. The algorithm is called via the function
`regularize_segments()`.

\cgalFigureBegin{regularize_simple_example, regularize_simple.svg}
A set of 2D segments before (red) and after (green) the angle and offset regularization.
\cgalFigureEnd

\cgalExample{Shape_regularization/regularize_simple.cpp}

\note As it can be seen from the example, the algorithm does not prioritize any directions
like vertical or horizontal but rather returns the optimal regularized configuration
of the input segments.


\subsection QP_Regularization_Segments_Delaunay Delaunay Neighbor Query

This class finds local neighbors of each segment by constructing a
Delaunay triangulation, using the class `CGAL::Delaunay_triangulation_2`, upon the center
points of the input segments. The local neighborhood of a segment is thus defined by
the corresponding one-ring neighborhood in the triangulation. The Delaunay triangulation
can be constructed only for a group of at least two segments.

The Delaunay neighbor query class constructs the Delaunay triangulation from a group of segments,
which has to be provided by the user through the `Segments::Delaunay_neighbor_query_2::add_group()`
method, and finds local neighbors of each segment only within the group. If this method
is never called, all input segments are treated as a group.

Note that a group can include fewer segments than in the input range. For example, if your input range
contains multiple segments, which contextually form three different groups of objects lets say
boundaries of three different buildings and you do not want to regularize these buildings with respect to each other,
but rather within each building boundary, in that case you should call the `add_group`
method three times. An example of such groups can be seen in \ref Regularize_15_Segments_Figure "this figure",
where you can see three groups of contextually similar segments: outer boundary, interior top rhombus
and interior bottom rhombus or in the figure below.

In this figure, there are two squares, one external and one internal. On the left, the red segments show
the connectivity among all input segments that is a Delaunay triangulation built upon all these segments,
while on the right, the green segments show the connectivity only among external square segments and
blue segments only among internal square segments.

\cgalFigureBegin{delaunay_groups, delaunay_groups.svg}

different groups with green Delaunay for the external segments and blue Delaunay for
the internal segments (right).

\subsection QP_Regularization_Segments_Angles Angle Regularization

This class orients 2D segments in order to reinforce parallelism and orthogonality among them.
To apply the angle regularization on a set of 2D segments, the user has to:
- specify the maximum angle deviation of a segment from its initial orientation that has to be within the
interval [0, 90] degrees. If no bound is provided, a bound of 25 degrees will be set as the default value;
- add groups of segments, if any, through the `Segments::Angle_regularization_2::add_group()` method.

After the optimization, each segment is rotated with respect to its midpoint.

\cgalFigureBegin{regularize_100_segments_angles_example, regularize_100_segments_angles.svg}
A generated set of 2D segments before (red) and after (green) the angle regularization.
\cgalFigureEnd

The following example demonstrates the usage of the shape regularization algorithm for angles
on a set of 100 near orthogonal segments generated with the help of \ref PkgGenerators "CGAL Geometric Object Generators".
The entire `InputRange` is provided to the angle regularization class as a group.
The maximum angle bound is set to 40 degrees.

\cgalExample{Shape_regularization/regularize_100_segments_angles.cpp}


\subsection QP_Regularization_Segments_Offset Offset Regularization

This class aligns 2D parallel segments in order to reinforce collinearity among them.
To apply the offset regularization on a set of 2D segments, the user has to:
- specify the maximum distance between two parallel segments that has to be within the
interval [0, +inf). If no bound is provided, a bound of 0.5 unit length will be set as the default value.
- add groups of parallel segments through the
`Segments::Offset_regularization_2::add_group()` method.
If the user does not have these groups, they can be obtained from \ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Angles
"Angle Regularization" by orienting original segments or from the utility function
`Segments::parallel_groups()`. See more details \ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Groups "here".

After the optimization, each segment is translated along its orthogonal direction.

Note that if the input segments within the same group are not exactly parallel, the distance, which
is defined as the distance between the midpoint of one segment and the projection of this point
onto the supporting line of another segment, is not a good metric to optimize positions of the
segments that may lead to deviations in the result from what the user would expect in case of
exactly parallel segments. The offset regularization does not internally orient segments to make
them exactly parallel. This is what the \ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Angles "Angle Regularization"
class for. The utility function `Segments::parallel_groups()` does not orient
segments either, but only returns groups of near-parallel segments.

\cgalFigureBegin{regularize_100_segments_offsets_example, regularize_100_segments_offsets.svg}
A generated set of 2D segments before (red) and after (green) the offset regularization.
\cgalFigureEnd

The following example demonstrates the usage of the shape regularization algorithm for offsets
on a set of 100 parallel segments located within a circle. The function
`Segments::parallel_groups()` is used to obtain the groups
of parallel segments. The maximum offset bound is set to 0.25 unit length.

\subsection QP_Regularization_Segments_Examples Angle + Offset Regularization

The following examples demonstrate the usage of the shape regularization algorithm for
both angles and offsets sequentially on a set of 2D segments.

The first example contains 15 segments. The angle and offset regularizations
are performed on these segments sequentially using the maximum bounds of 10 degrees and 0.1 unit length
respectively. We also show here how to create and work with contextually similar groups of segments and
regularize each group on its own. The defined groups are the outer boundary, top and
bottom rhombus. Since the shape regularization algorithm on segments is based on the
\ref QP_Regularization framework, this example also shows how to use that framework
directly instead of calling the function `regularize_segments()`.

\cgalExample{Shape_regularization/regularize_15_segments.cpp}

The second example contains 65 segments, which are constructed from a set of input points.
All points are organized into groups such that each group represents an approximate 2D line.
Organizing points into such groups can be achieved with the \ref PkgShapeDetection package. We fit a
segment to each group of points using the \ref PkgPrincipalComponentAnalysisD "Principal Component Analysis" package.
The angle and offset regularizations are performed on these segments sequentially
using the bounds of 80 degrees and 2 unit lengths respectively.

\cgalExample{Shape_regularization/regularize_real_data_2.cpp}


\subsection QP_Regularization_Segments_Utils Utility Functions

In addition to the main algorithm, we also provide several utility functions, which
are often used in conjunction with the algorithm.


\subsubsection QP_Regularization_Segments_Groups Grouping Segments

This \cgal component also provides three ways to group segments:
- `Segments::parallel_groups()` - organizes a set
of unordered 2D segments into groups of parallel segments.
- `Segments::orthogonal_groups()` - organizes a set
of unordered 2D segments into groups of orthogonal segments.
- `Segments::collinear_groups()` - organizes a set
of unordered 2D segments into groups of collinear segments.

\cgalFigureBegin{parallel_groups, groups.svg}
Groups of near parallel (left), near orthogonal (center), and near collinear (right) segments.
Red, green, blue colors indicate groups within each set of 2D segments.
\cgalFigureEnd

The function `Segments::parallel_groups()` enables users
to form groups of parallel segments. For example, if you know that all your segments are already
near parallel to each other within some tolerance error and you do not want to orient them by applying
the \ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Angles "Angle Regularization" algorithm, but you still need
to make them collinear by minimizing the offset among parallel segments using the
\ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Offset "Offset Regularization" algorithm, you can
create the groups of parallel segments by using this function and provide them as input
to the offset regularization algorithm as we do it \ref QP_Parallel_Groups_Example "here".

The other two functions serve a similar goal. The one `Segments::orthogonal_groups()`
first creates groups of parallel segments and then merges them into groups, where all
segments are either parallel or orthogonal to each other. The one `Segments::collinear_groups()`
first creates groups of parallel segments and then splits each of these groups
into groups of collinear segments, if any.

\note Note that none of these functions applies the regularization of the input segments. They
only return groups of indices of segments with similar orientations and/or positions.


\subsubsection QP_Regularization_Segments_Simplification Simplifying Segments

After regularizing angles and offsets, simplifying segments with similar properties
is a common post-processing task. This \cgal component provides an utility function
`Segments::unique_segments()` that takes a set of input segments, groups them with
respect to the collinearity property, and then returns for each group of collinear segments
a segment that best fits this group (see the figure below).

\note Even if the segments are far away from each other but close with respect to the
orthogonal distance between them that is they are almost collinear, they will be merged
as the blue segments in the figure.

\cgalFigureBegin{unique_segments, unique_segments.svg}
Input segments with multiple collinear segments (left) are simplified into unique segments (right).
\cgalFigureEnd


\subsection QP_Regularization_Segments_Performance Performance

The performance of the shape regularization algorithm mostly depends
on the used QP solver. When using the `CGAL::OSQP_quadratic_program_traits` model,
we exploit and efficiently use the sparse nature of the related QP problem that leads
to quick performances in practice.

The plot (solid) below shows how the computation time depends on the number of input segments.
We first observe that the most challenging step is angle regularization while the offset
regularization is much faster. This is an effect of complexity reduction by segmenting
the problem into groups for offset regularization. Since each group of parallel segments is much
smaller than the original set of input segments, the total computation time is smaller, too.
The same idea can be applied to accelerate the angle regularization. Splitting input segments
into groups with contextually similar properties from the very beginning will lead to better
performance as indicated in the plot (dashed). However, note that not each data set can be meaningfully
split into such groups.

To benchmark the algorithm, we used a MacBook Pro 2018 with 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 processor
(6 cores) and 32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4 memory. The installed operating system was OS X 10.15 Catalina.
We first create a set of random segments in a square such that all segments are either
parallel to the X axis or Y axis. We then slightly perturb all segments by a random angle
within the interval [-15, 15] degrees and apply the regularization algorithm 10 times
on the same input. The returned time is the average time over all iterations. In the pre-grouped
version, we regroup all segments into groups of 10 segments and the regularization algorithm is
applied to each group. For example, in case of 50 input segments, we will have 5 input groups.
Since the groups are very small, there is no much difference in time between angle and
offset regularizations. The results are shown in the figure below.

\cgalFigureBegin{qp_segments_bench, qp_segments_bench.svg}

regrouping input segments and with the groups of 10 segments for angles (dashed red)
and offsets (dashed green).

\section Contour_Regularization Contours

Given a set of ordered 2D points connected by segments, which form a contour, closed
or open, users can reinforce three types of regularities among consecutive edges of this contour:
- *Parallelism*: contour edges, which are detected as near parallel, are made exactly parallel.
- *Orthogonality*: contour edges, which are detected as near orthogonal, are made exactly orthogonal.
- *Collinearity*: parallel contour edges, which are detected as near collinear, are made exactly collinear.

A typical use of this algorithm consists of the following steps:
1. Specify a type of the contour, open or closed;
2. Create an instance of the class `ContourDirections` with the proper parameters;
3. Call the function `regularize_closed_contour()` or `regularize_open_contour()`.

We assume that each contour has at least one principal direction that is a reference
direction towards which the contour edges are rotated. Given a set of such directions
either estimated or user-specified, each edge is made either parallel or orthogonal
to these direction(s).

To estimate principal directions of the contour, this component provides three
models of the concept `ContourDirections`:
- `Contours::Longest_direction_2` - sets the longest contour edge as the only principal direction.
- `Contours::Multiple_directions_2` - tries to estimate multiple principal directions
in the contour based on the user-specified parameters (see the figure below).
- `Contours::User_defined_directions_2` - sets the user-specified
principal directions as contour directions.

\cgalFigureBegin{multiple_directions, multiple_directions.svg}
A closed contour before (red) and after (green) the contour regularization.
The found principal directions are marked yellow.
\cgalFigureEnd

After the directions are set, the algorithm is linear in the number of contour edges. It first goes
through each contour edge and orients it towards the best-fit direction. In the second step,
all parallel consecutive edges are merged if they are within a user-specified maximum tolerance distance.
The distance here is defined as the distance between the midpoint of the first edge and the
projection of this point onto the supporting line of the next edge. The position of the
merged segment is optimized with respect to its neighbors. In the last steps, all segments
are reconnected into a contour as shown in the figure below. Due to the merging step,
the number of output edges in the contour is not necessarily the same as the number of input edges.

\cgalFigureBegin{contours_pipeline, contours_pipeline.svg}
Steps of the contour regularization algorithm (from left to right):
the closed contour before regularization; the disconnected contour with edges rotated
towards the found principal directions, here we have only one direction; the optimized
edges, blue edges were merged and their positions were optimized; and the final reconnected contour.
\cgalFigureEnd

If the user wants to rotate each contour edge on its own towards the best-fit direction
without reconnecting them after into a closed/open contour, she can either use the
\ref QP_Regularization_Segments "Segment Regularization" algorithm or she can orient
each segment by calling the `ContourDirections::orient()` method.

The example below shows the most straightforward entry point to the algorithm, where
we regularize a simple closed contour. The algorithm is called via the function `regularize_closed_contour()`.

\cgalFigureBegin{regularize_contour_example, regularize_contour.svg}
A closed contour before (red) and after (green) regularization.
\cgalFigureEnd

\cgalExample{Shape_regularization/regularize_contour.cpp}


\subsection Contour_Regularization_Closed Closed Contours

In the example below, we regularize a closed contour. We use multiple directions
estimator, which returns only one direction, because the contour is quite rectilinear.
In fact, the returned direction in this case coincides with the longest edge direction.

\cgalFigureBegin{regularize_closed_contour_example, regularize_closed_contour.svg}
A closed contour before (red) and after (green) the contour regularization.
\cgalFigureEnd

\cgalExample{Shape_regularization/regularize_closed_contour.cpp}


\subsection Contour_Regularization_Open Open Contours

Open contours are contours where the head and tail of the contour are not connected.
This case requires a special treatment, but the core of the algorithm is the same.
In the example below, we regularize an open contour with respect to
its longest edge. This example also shows how to provide a property map to the algorithm
in order to give the algorithm access to the coordinates of the contour vertices.

\cgalFigureBegin{regularize_open_contour_example, regularize_open_contour.svg}
An open contour before (red) and after (green) the contour regularization.
\cgalFigureEnd

\cgalExample{Shape_regularization/regularize_open_contour.cpp}


\subsection Contour_Regularization_Performance Performance

The contour regularization algorithms, both closed and open, have, in practice, a
linear time behavior with respect to the number of contour vertices. In fact, the time
is not linear, as you can see in the plot below, due to the second step of merging consecutive
collinear edges. For some polygons, the number of such edges is quite high and before merging
them into one segment, we collect all of them into a group in order to find the best optimal
position to place the final segment that may lead to a slower performance in some cases.

To benchmark the algorithm, we used a MacBook Pro 2018 with 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 processor
(6 cores) and 32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4 memory. The installed operating system was OS X 10.15 Catalina.
We first create a rectilinear polygon with the required number of edges. We then slightly perturb
all edges by a random angle within the interval [-15, 15] degrees and apply the regularization
algorithm 10 times on the same input. The returned time is the average time over all iterations.
The results are shown in the figure below.

\cgalFigureBegin{contours_bench, contours_bench.svg}
Time in seconds to regularize closed (red) and open (green) contours.
\cgalFigureEnd


\section Plane_Regularization Planes

Given a set of 3D planes with their corresponding inlier sets, users can reinforce four
types of regularities among these planes using the function `regularize_planes()`:
- *Parallelism*: planes, which are detected as near parallel, are made exactly parallel.
- *Orthogonality*: planes, which are detected as near orthogonal, are made exactly orthogonal.
- *Coplanarity*: parallel planes, which are detected as near coplanar, are made exactly coplanar.
- *Axis-Symmetry*: planes, which are detected as near symmetrical with respect to a user-specified axis,
are made exactly symmetrical.

The user can choose to regularize only one or several of these four properties.
The process is greedy and based on a hierarchical decomposition (coplanar clusters are subgroups of parallel clusters,
which are subgroups of axis-symmetric and orthogonal clusters) as described by Verdie et al. in \cgalCite{cgal:vla-lod-15}.

The following example illustrates how to use the plane regularization function.

\cgalExample{Shape_regularization/regularize_planes.cpp}

\note Please note that this function used to be a part of the \ref PkgShapeDetection package. You can
still use the old API of that function, however to avoid parameters ambiguity, we strongly
suggest to use the new API with the \ref BGLNamedParameters "Named Parameters" mechanism.


\section QP_Regularization QP Regularization

The shape regularization component is a generic framework that is based on the
Quadratic Programming (QP) global regularization algorithm \cgalCite{cgal:bl-kippi-18}
by Bauchet et Lafarge. You should refer to this section only if you want to know details
on how the shape regularization framework is organized internally or you want to extend
that framework by implementing your own regularization types.

\ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Angles "Angle Regularization" and
\ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Offset "Offset Regularization" that we presented before
are two particular instances of this algorithm. Other instances can be added by the user,
as explained \ref QP_Regularization_Implementation "here".


\subsection QP_Regularization_Framework Framework

This framework follows Section 3 from \cgalCite{cgal:bl-kippi-18}, however the algorithm
from that paper was extended and generalized. The idea behind the main algorithm is
to minimize the energy

<center>\f$U(\boldsymbol{x}) = (1 - \lambda) D(\boldsymbol{x}) + \lambda V(\boldsymbol{x})\f$,</center>

where \f$\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1, \dots, x_n)\f$ is a configuration of perturbations operated
on \f$n\f$ input items, \f$D(\boldsymbol{x})\f$ and \f$V(\boldsymbol{x})\f$ represent a data
term and pairwise potential respectively, and \f$\lambda \in [0, 1]\f$ is a parameter weighting
these two terms. By setting up the correct types of \f$D(\boldsymbol{x})\f$ and \f$V(\boldsymbol{x})\f$,
the problem can be reformulated into a quadratic optimization problem with \f$(n + m)\f$ variables
and \f$2(n + m)\f$ linear constraints, where \f$m\f$ is the number of unique pairs formed by connecting
an item to one of its closest neighbors. Let us explain how it all works when the input items
are segments and we want to regularize their orientations in order to reinforce parallelism and
orthogonality among them.

To set up the framework, we first need to find closest neighbors for each segment.
These neighbors are provided via the concept `NeighborQuery`. Internally, we create a graph
based on these neighbors. Every edge \f$\{i, j\}\f$, where \f$i\f$ is the index of the ith
segment and \f$j\f$ is the index of the jth segment is inserted in the graph whenever \f$i < j\f$.
This way each pair is inserted only once. The neighbors are found via the \ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Delaunay
"Delaunay Neighbor Query".

When we have the graph, we fill in the terms \f$D(\boldsymbol{x})\f$ and \f$V(\boldsymbol{x})\f$
via the concept `RegularizationType`. First, we obtain a maximum perturbation bound for each segment
via the method `RegularizationType::bound()`. Since we want to rotate segments, we return here
the maximum allowed angle deviation for each segment with respect to its original orientation, lets
say 25 degrees.

Next, for every edge \f$\{i, j\}\f$ in the graph, we compute the perturbation difference between
two segments \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$ via the method `RegularizationType::target()`. For example,
that could be a difference of segment orientations with respect to \f$90\f$ or \f$180\f$ degrees. Lets say
an angle between two segments is \f$85\f$ degrees then we return \f$90 - 85 = 5\f$ degrees
since this is what we should minimize in order to make the two segments orthogonal to each other.

Then we set up the quadratic programming problem that is solved via the `QuadraticProgramTraits` concept. The
returned result is stored as a vector of the length \f$(n + m)\f$ with the updated perturbation values,
where the first \f$n\f$ values are the values that should be added to the original orientations
of the input segments in order to update them and the last \f$m\f$ values are minimized to zeros. The
update is achieved via the method `RegularizationType::update()`.

Overall, the class `QP_regularization` is parameterized by:
- `NeighborQuery` that provides the means for accessing local neighbors of an item,
- `RegularizationType` that determines a regularization type to be applied, and
- `QuadraticProgramTraits` that is used to solve the corresponding QP problem.

Within this generic framework, users can regularize any set of input items provided
their own neighbor search, regularization type, and QP solver.


\subsection QP_Regularization_Neighborhood Neighborhood

The concept `NeighborQuery` provides the means for accessing local neighbors of an item.
To create a model that respects this concept, the user has to provide an overload of the operator:

- `NeighborQuery::operator()()` that has to fill in a vector with indices of all items, which
are neighbors of the query item.

For example, given a segment, this operator may return a vector with indices of some other
input segments, which are within a certain distance from this segment, however this distance
is measured. See above and \ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Delaunay "this section" for more details.


\subsection QP_Regularization_Type Regularization

The concept `RegularizationType` determines a type of regularization to be applied.
To create a model that respects this concept, three functions have to be defined:

- `RegularizationType::target()` a function that estimates a type of regularity between two neighbors,
- `RegularizationType::bound()` a function that returns a maximum bound on the allowed regularity change, and
- `RegularizationType::update()` a function that updates input items with respect to the modified regularities.

For example, if we want to regularize segment orientations, that is to make segments parallel and orthogonal
to each other, the first function should return an angle perturbation between a query segment and each of its neighbors;
the second function should return a maximum angle within which a rotation of the query segment is accepted;
and the third function should update original orientations of the input segments.
See above and \ref QP_Regularization_Segments_Angles "this section" for more details.


\subsection QP_Regularization_Solvers Solvers

In order to solve the associated QP problem of the algorithm above, \cgal provides
a wrapper `CGAL::OSQP_quadratic_program_traits` of the external \ref thirdpartyOSQP "OSQP solver"
that is a model of the concept `QuadraticProgramTraits`.

Alternatively, the internal CGAL solver from the package \ref PkgQPSolver "Linear and Quadratic Programming Solver"
can be used, however we do not recommend applying it. The internal quadratic program that has to be solved
for shape regularization is sparse. The \cgal version will internally convert this problem
into a dense one that takes considerable effort to solve, while the OSQP version takes a special care
of the sparse nature of the problem that leads to better performance. Since the class `QP_regularization`
is parameterized by the general concept `QuadraticProgramTraits`, the users are also welcome to provide
their own version of the solver.


\subsection QP_Regularization_Implementation Implementation

If you want to implement your own regularization approach that follows the same
framework, for example to reinforce a different type of regularity than is already provided,
you have to implement your own model of the \ref QP_Regularization_Type "RegularizationType"
concept and possibly a model of the \ref QP_Regularization_Neighborhood "NeighborQuery" concept.
These concepts are used to parameterize the main `QP_regularization` algorithm:
1. Use `NeighborQuery` to find local neighbors of each input item;
2. Use `RegularizationType` to estimate current regularities among these neighbors;
3. Use `RegularizationType` to set maximum bounds on the allowed regularity changes;
4. Use `QuadraticProgramTraits` to solve the quadratic programming problem;
5. Use `RegularizationType` to update input items with respect to the modified regularities.

In addition, the user may also want to change a \ref QP_Regularization_Solvers "QP solver"
if he knows how to optimize it for a specific type of input data. To do that, the user
has to implement a model of the `QuadraticProgramTraits` concept.

An example below shows how to define your own type of the above concepts and how to
choose among available solvers.

\cgalExample{Shape_regularization/regularize_framework.cpp}


\section Shape_Regularization_History History

The shape regularization algorithm for 2D segments was first implemented by Jean-Philippe Bauchet
under the supervision of Florent Lafarge and then generalized by Gennadii Sytov during the Google Summer
of Code 2019 under the supervision of Dmitry Anisimov. The contour regularization algorithm was
developed and implemented by Dmitry Anisimov and Simon Giraudot. Plane regularization
was added by Simon Giraudot based on the prototype version developed by Florent Lafarge.
