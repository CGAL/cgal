* Comment the code.
* Spell check all files.
* Check memory leaking.

* Install OSQP on all testing platforms.
* Add a 3D version of the QP regularization algorithm.
* Add an opencv tutorial with the global segments regularization over the Chicago map.
* Should we carry out a rigorous performance analysis?
* Do we actually care about the clockwise/counterclockwise order in the contours? Yes, if it is an open contour. For closed contours, the visual result is identical however the order of the vertices is reversed. For open contours, the visual result is not identical.
* Think what I can do with all examples.
* Add try-catch in the qp solver.
