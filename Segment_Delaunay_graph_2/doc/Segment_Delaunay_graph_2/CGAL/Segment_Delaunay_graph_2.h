/*!
\ingroup PkgSegmentDelaunayGraph2Ref

The class `Segment_Delaunay_graph_2` represents the segment Delaunay graph (which is
the dual graph of the 2D segment Voronoi diagram).
Currently it only supports the insertions of sites.

\tparam Gt must be a model of `SegmentDelaunayGraphTraits_2`.

\tparam St must be a model of `SegmentDelaunayGraphStorageTraits_2`.
        By default, the storage traits is instantiated by `Segment_Delaunay_graph_storage_traits_2<Gt>`.

\tparam DS must be a model of `SegmentDelaunayGraphDataStructure_2` whose vertex and face are
        models of the concepts `SegmentDelaunayGraphVertexBase_2` and `TriangulationFaceBase_2`, respectively.
        It defaults to:
        \code
        CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2<
                  CGAL::Segment_Delaunay_graph_vertex_base_2<St>,
                  CGAL::Segment_Delaunay_graph_face_base_2<Gt> >
        \endcode

\cgalHeading{Storage}

To avoid redundancy in the storage of points, input points are stored in a container,
and the various types of sites (input points and segments, points of intersection,
subsegments with one or two points of intersection as endpoints) only store handles to the points
in the container. See Section \ref Segment_Delaunay_graph_2StronglyIntersecting for more information.

\cgalHeading{Traversal of the Segment Delaunay Graph}

A segment Delaunay graph can be seen as a container of faces and
vertices. Therefore the `Segment_Delaunay_graph_2` class provides several iterators
and circulators that allow to traverse it (completely or partially).
