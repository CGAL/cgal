== To follow Triangle ==

  - Implement off-centers
  
  - Implement Chew’s algorithm instead of Ruppert's

== Old TODO list ==

- Implement a method to split all clusters at the beginnning.

- Histograms in the demo

- do not use default constructor of Geom_traits

- Rewrite Double_map.h [!]

- draw() called twice in mesh_demo [!]
