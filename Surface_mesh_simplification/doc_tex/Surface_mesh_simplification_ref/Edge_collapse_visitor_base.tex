\ccDefinition

The class \ccRefName\ provides a base class for models of the \ccc{EdgeCollapseSimplificationVisitor} concept.
It has one template argument: the type of surface being simplified,
which must be a model of the \ccc{EdgeCollapsableMesh} concept.

This base class implements all of the visitor's callbacks. 
This way, users need only override the callbacks they are interested in.
The callbacks {\em are not virtual} because this is not a dynamically polymorphic base class
and the derived visitor will never be used polymorphically at runtime (is perfectly fine to override 
and hide a non-virtual method in the context of the static polymorphism used in the simplification algorithm).
