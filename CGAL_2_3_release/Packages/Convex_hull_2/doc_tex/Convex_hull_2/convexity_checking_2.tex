\section{Convexity Checking}

The functions \ccc{is_ccw_strongly_convex_2} and \ccc{is_cw_strongly_convex_2}
check whether a given sequence of 2D points forms a (counter)clockwise strongly
convex polygon.\ccIndexMainItem{convexity checking, 2D}%
\ccIndexSubitem{polygon}{strongly convex}.  These are used in postcondition
testing of the two-dimensional convex hull functions%
