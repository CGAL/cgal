\section{Release Note}

Beginning with \cgal\ R2.3, this package has been replaced with a new
design.  The old files are still available for backwards compatibility
and to support older compiler, such as MSVC++6.0. However their use is
deprecated and the manual page are not converted into the new
reference manual format. Instead they are collected in the manual
here. See the regular user and reference manual for the new.%

For the polyhedral surface, old and new design cannot be used
simultaneously (they have identical include file names and class
names). The include files select automatically the old design for
MSVC++6.0 and the new design otherwise. This automatism can be
overwritten by defining appropriate macros before the include
files. The old design is selected with the 
\texttt{CGAL\_USE\_POLYHEDRON\_DESIGN\_ONE} macro. The new design 
is selected with the 
\texttt{CGAL\_USE\_POLYHEDRON\_DESIGN\_TWO} macro.

This chapter presents polyhedral surfaces in three dimensions. They
are a collection of vertices, edges and facets with an incidence
relationship on them. The organization beneath is a halfedge data
structure which restricts the class of representable surfaces to
orientable 2-manifolds -- with and without boundary. In the case of a
closed surface we call it a {\em polyhedron}.

\subsection*{Design Rationale}

Chapter~\ref{chapterHds} gives a design overview of the
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} concept, its flexibility, predefined
models and their potential use in data structures such as polyhedral
surfaces, see also~\cite{k-ddsps-98}. A halfedge data structure is an
edge-centered data structure. Each edge is decomposed into two
halfedges with opposite orientations. Functions are provided to access
incident facets and vertices. For a facet or a vertex one of the
incident halfedges can be accessed. A halfedge data structure is
responsible of storing the halfedges, vertices and facets, as well as
maintaining their incidences through a pointer based interface.

A polyhedral surface is based on a model of the
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} concept and adds combinatorial integrity
(e.g. internal pointers cannot be simply written), abstract concepts
to access the items, such as iterators and circulators, high level
operations and ease-of-use, for example Euler operators. It also adds
knowledge about the geometric information kept in the data structure,
such as points or plane equations, with a traits class.

The class \ccc{Polyhedron} can store polyhedra and polyhedral
surfaces. The template argument for the \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure}
allows to choose among the different possible models, for example a
list or a vector based representation.  Using a vector provides random
access for the elements in the polyhedral surface and is more space
efficient, but elements cannot be deleted arbitrarily. Using a list
allows arbitrary deletions, but provides only bidirectional iterators
and is less space efficient. The provided default model for the
halfedge data structure
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure_polyhedron_default_3<R>} chooses the
list representation and \ccc{Point_3<R>} for the geometric
information stored with vertices and \ccc{Plane_3<R>} for the
geometric information stored with facets.

A utility class \ccc{Polyhedron_incremental_builder_3} helps in
creating polyhedral surfaces from a list of points followed by a list
of facets represented as indices into the point list. This is
particularly useful in combination with usual file formats for polyhedra.

\subsection*{Organization of this Chapter}

Section~\ref{sectionPolyhedron} introduces the polyhedral surface
class \ccc{Polyhedron_3}, its three local classes \ccc{Vertex},
\ccc{Halfedge}, and \ccc{Facet}. Section~\ref{sectionPolyTraits}
defines the \ccc{Polyhedron_traits} concept, which adds the geometric
knowledge to the polyhedral surface, and
Section~\ref{sectionPolyTraitsModels} names the provided models for
this concept.  Section~\ref{sectionPolyHds} presents additional
requirements for the \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} concept that were
recognized by the polyhedral surface and states the default models
that fulfills these requirements, see also Chapter~\ref{chapterHds} on
halfedge data structure. Section~\ref{sectionPolyIncrBuilder}
continues with the description of the utility class for incremental
construction of polyhedral surfaces.
Section~\ref{sectionPolyExamples} concludes this chapter with examples
using polyhedral surfaces.

\ccHeading{Release Note}

Beginning with \cgal\ R2.3, this package has been replaced with a new
design. The old design is still available and documented here, see the
remark at the beginning of this chapter. See the regular user and
reference manual for the new design.

\ccDefinition  

A polyhedral surface \ccClassTemplateName\ in three dimensions
consists of vertices $V$, edges $E$, facets $F$ and an incidence
relation on them.  Each edge is represented by two halfedges with
opposite orientations.

\begin{ccTexOnly}
    \vspace{-7mm}

      \parbox{0.4\textwidth}{%
          \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{fig/halfedge.ips}%

    \end{center}
    \vspace{-5mm}
\end{ccTexOnly}

\end{ccHtmlOnly}

Vertices represent points in space. Edges are straight line segments
between two endpoints. Facets are planar polygons without holes
defined by the circular sequence of halfedges along their boundary.
The polyhedral surface itself is allowed to have holes. The halfedges
along the boundary of a hole are called {\em border halfedges\/} and
have no incident facets. An edge is a {\em border edge\/} if one of
its halfedges is a border halfedge.  A surface is {\em closed\/} if it
contains no border halfedges. A closed surface is a boundary
representation for polyhedra in three dimensions. The convention is
that the halfedges are oriented counterclockwise around facets as seen
from the outside of the polyhedron. An implication is that the
halfedges are oriented clockwise around the vertices. The notion of
the solid side of a facet as defined by the halfedge orientation
extends to polyhedral surfaces with border edges although they do not
define a closed object. If normal vectors are considered for the
facets, normals point outwards (following the right hand rule).

One implication of the definition is that the polyhedral surface is
always an orientable and oriented 2-manifold with border edges,
i.e.~the neighborhood of each point on the polyhedral surface is
either homeomorphic to a disc or to a half disc, except for vertices
where many holes and surfaces can meet. Another implication is that
the smallest representable surface is a triangle (for polyhedral
surfaces with border edges) or a tetrahedron (for polyhedra). Boundary
representations of orientable 2-manifolds are closed under Euler
operations. They are extended with operations that create or close
holes in the surface.

Other intersections besides the incidence relation are not allowed,
although they are not automatically handled, since self intersections
are not easy to check efficiently. \ccClassTemplateName\ does only
maintain the combinatorial integrity of the polyhedral surface (using
Euler operations) and does not consider the coordinates of the points
or any geometric information.

The class \ccClassTemplateName\ can represent polyhedral surfaces as
well as polyhedra. The interface is designed in such a way that it
is easy to ignore border edges and work only with polyhedra.

The sequence of edges can be ordered in the data structure on request
such that the sequence starts with the non-border edges and ends with
the border edges. Border edges are then itself ordered such that the
halfedge which is incident to the facet came first and the halfedge
incident to the hole came thereafter. This normalization step counts
simultaneously the number of border edges. This number is zero if and
only if the surface is a closed polyhedron. Note that this class does
not maintain this counter during further modifications. There is no
automatic caching done for auxiliary information.

The class \ccc{Polyhedron_3<Traits,HDS>} expects a model of the
\ccc{Polyhedron_traits} concept from Section~\ref{sectionPolyTraits}
as a first template argument, and a model of the
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} concept from Section~\ref{sectionHds}
with the additional requirements from Section~\ref{sectionPolyHds} as a second
template argument.

\begin{ccAdvanced}
  
Halfedges incident to an hole are called {\em border halfedges}. An
edge is a {\em border edge\/} if one of its two halfedges is a border
halfedges. The only requirement to work with border halfedges is
that the \ccc{Halfedge} class provides a member function
\ccc{is_border()} returning a \ccc{bool}. Usually, the halfedge data
structure supports facets and a \ccc{NULL} facet pointer will
indicate a border halfedge, but this is not the only possibility.
The \ccc{is_border()} predicate divides the edges into two classes,
the border edges and the non-border edges. The following
normalization reorganizes the sequential storage of the edges such
that the non-border edges precedes the border edges, and that for
each border edge the latter one of the two halfedges is a border
halfedge (the first one is a non-border halfedge in conformance with
the polyhedral surface definition). The normalization stores the
number of border halfedges and the halfedge iterator the border
edges start at within the data structure.  Halfedge insertion or
removal and changing the border status of a halfedge may invalidate
these values, which are not automatically updated.

\ccThree{Halfe}{dge_handleP.erase_all();M;;;}{}

\ccMethod{void   normalize_border();}
    {sorts halfedges such that the non-border edges precedes the

depicts the relationship between a
halfedge and its incident halfedges, vertices, and facets.  A halfedge
is an oriented edge between two vertices. It is always paired with its
counterpart that has the opposite direction. They are mutually linked
with the \ccc{opposite()} member function. If a halfedge is incident
to a facet the \ccc{next()} member function points to the successor
halfedge around this facet. For border edges the \ccc{next()} member
function points to the successor halfedge along some hole (which might
not be uniquely determined in situations with more than one hole at a
vertex).  An invariant is that successive assignments of the form
\ccc{h = h->next()} cycles counterclockwise around the facet and
traverses all halfedges incident to this facet. A similar invariant is
that successive assignments of the form \ccc{h =
  h->next()->opposite()} cycles clockwise around the vertex and
traverses all halfedges incident to this vertex. Two circulators are
provided for these circular orders. \ccc{next()} and \ccc{opposite()}
are mandatory functions for each instantiation of polyhedral surfaces.
The other member functions are optional
as indicated with the type tags defined in
\ccc{Polyhedron_3}, see Section~\ref{sectionPolyhedron}.
The \ccc{prev()} member function points to the preceding halfedge around
the same facet.  Handles to the incident vertex and facet are
optionally stored.

\section{An Incremental Builder for Polyhedral Surfaces}
% +========================================================================+
\label{sectionPolyIncrBuilder}

\ccCreationVariable{B}

\ccDefinition  

\ccClassTemplateName\ is an auxiliary class that supports the
incremental construction of polyhedral surfaces. This is for example
convenient when constructing polyhedral surfaces from file formats
like the Object File Format (OFF)~\cite{p-gmgv15-94},
OpenInventor~\cite{w-impoo-94} or VRML~\cite{bpp-vrml-95,vrmls-96}.
\ccClassTemplateName\ needs access to the internal halfedge data
structure of type \ccc{HDS} of the polyhedral surface. It is intended
to be used within a modifier, see \ccc{Modifier_base} in the
Support Library Manual.

The incremental builder might be of broader interest for other
halfedge data structures as well, but it is specifically bound to the
definition of polyhedral surfaces given here. During construction all
conditions of polyhedral surfaces are checked and in case of violation
an error status is set. A diagnostic message will be printed to
\ccc{std::cerr} if the \ccc{verbose} flag has been set at construction time.

The incremental construction starts with a list of all point
coordinates and concludes with a list of all facet polygons. Edges are
not explicitly specified. They are derived from the vertex incidence
information provided from the facet polygons. The polygons are given as a
sequence of vertex indices.  The halfedge data structure \ccc{HDS} must
support vertices (i.e.~\ccc{Supports_halfedge_vertex} $\equiv$
\ccc{Tag_true}). The correct protocol of method calls to build a
polyhedral surface is given as a regular expression below. Vertices and
facets can be added in arbitrary order as long as
\ccc{add_vertex_to_facet()} refers only to vertex indices that are
already known.

homogeneous representation with {\tt int} coordinates is sufficient.
The output of the program are the four plane equations.

\subsection{Example Declaring a Point Iterator}

It might be preferable to have an iterator enumerating all points
directly instead of all vertices as in the previous example. Such an 
iterator could be used in other algorithms, for example a convex hull
computation. The following declaration gives us such a point iterator.

\begin{verbatim}
#include <CGAL/Iterator_project.h>
#include <CGAL/function_objects.h>

typedef Polyhedron::Vertex                                Vertex;
typedef Polyhedron::Vertex_iterator                       Vertex_iterator;
typedef Project_point<Vertex>                             Project_point;
typedef Iterator_project<Vertex_iterator, Project_point>  Point_iterator;
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt for}-loop of the previous example could now be replaced with
the following loop:

\begin{verbatim}
    Point_iterator begin = P.vertices_begin();
    for ( ; begin != P.vertices_end(); ++begin)
        cout << "(" << (*begin) << ") ";
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Example Writing Object File Format (OFF) with STL Algorithms}

The following example creates a tetrahedron and writes it to
\ccc{cout} using the Object File Format (OFF)~\cite{p-gmgv15-94}.
The example makes advanced use of \stl\ algorithms (\ccc{copy},
\ccc{distance}), \stl\ \ccc{ostream_iterator} and \cgal\ circulators.

\subsection{Example Using the Incremental Builder and Modifier Mechanism}

The \ccc{Polyhedron_incremental_builder_3} class is used to create
a triangle using the modifier mechanism as described in the Support
Library Manual.
