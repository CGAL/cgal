- Added Point_d to Cartesian

Version 3.2.4 (September 2 1999)
- Removed references to <CGAL/Kernel/function_objects_?.h>

  for the future if M$VC++ starts accepting them.
- Added definitions of Cartesian_3::*_2, even though I do not include the

- temporary scheme by Stefan Schirra, which does not assume it
- new config flag: CGAL_CFG_NO_ADVANCED_KERNEL to check for Michael's design
  availability vs Stefan's
- Michael' scheme by default, use -DCGAL_CFG_NO_ADVANCED_KERNEL for Stefan's design
  (requires $CGAL/test/NewKernel, which can be found in CGAL-2.1-I-x , x>=12)
  until the flag is added in the release
- Different files for Cartesian_2.h and Cartesian_3.h
  and different kernel traits Cartesian_2 and Cartesian_3

  number.

Ver 1.0 (16 June 1998)
- From Andreas Fabri and Stefan Schirra's original implementation.
- Separated from package C2  (because there was no reason that it
  belongs more to C2 than to C3, and then confusion ensues).
- Changes by Stefan Schirra:
* Compile-time-tags for representation classes added in new
    file representation_tags.h (included in ..._rep.h files)
* classes CGAL_PointCd<FT> and CGAL_PointHd<FT,RT> declared

Version 3.3.1 (September 3 1999)
- Added headers to .C files

Version 3.3 (September 3 1999)
- The typename added in 3.2.3 crashes VC++, hence the #define typename for VC++

  should have been typenamed R::FT

Version 3.2.4 (September 2 1999)

  (should have been typename LineC2<R..>::Point_2)

Version 3.2.3 (September 2 1999)
- added needed typename in all <CGAL/Cartesian/*.C>
  indeed, Class_2<R>::Subclass needs a typename qualifier for MIPSPRO 7.3
  although it worked with the other compilers

Version 3.2.2 (September 2 1999)
- fixed include files that still included <CGAL/...C2.h>
  [worked with symlinks, but not in releases newer than 2.1-I-13]

- each file Class_2.h is not separated into Class_2.h (interface declaration)
  and Class_2.C (method definitions) for easier inclusion of all *.h before *.C
- each file Class_2.h can now be included independently of the others and of the
  representation class (as long as the template parameter R defines the other
  classes in the kernel)
****IMPORTANT: please note
- for now, while we still have two versions, two scripts (create_symlinks and
  remove_symlinks) are included which have to be run before the test suite.
  when using Michael's design. (Nothing to be done for Stefan's design!)
  This is to prevent inclusion of the wrong files *C2.h and *_2.h
  (now we want to include <CGAL/Cartesian/*_2.h> instead of *C2.h)

   Less_distance_to_point_3

Version 4.4  (6 April 2000) [my]
- added a typename in Cartesian/Iso_cuboid_3.C

Version 4.3  (29 March 2000) [my]
- fixed bugs in Iso_cuboid_3.C :
 #include <CGAL/Cartesian/predicates_on_points_3.h> 
instead of
#include <CGAL/predicates_on_points_3.h> 
-fixed  has_on_unbounded_side

Version 4.2 (28 March 2000) [my]
- fixed bugs in Iso_cuboid_3.C concerning
  min(), max() and bounded_side()
- suppress compare_dominance and compare_submittance in
  predicates_on_points_3.h and predicates/kernel_ftC3.h
- add dominance() and strict_dominance instead in
  predicates_on_points_3.h and predicates/kernel_ftC3.h

Version 4.1 (22 March 2000)
- fixed Iso_cuboid_3 again [my]
- added maintainer file
- changed Makefile to include maintainer file in package

Version 4.0.5 (28 February 2000)
- fixed Iso_cuboid_3 stuff [my]

Version 4.0.4 (Janvier 27 2000)
- make the changed required by Dima in Point_3.C Vector_3.C and Direction_3.C
  that is changed the 
	return (cond) ? foo : bar;
  into
	if (cond) return foo;
	return bar;

Version 4.0.3 (December 14 1999)
- Forgot a typename in Tetrahedron_3
- Use lexicographical comparison in Tetrahedron (instead of
  reimplementing it)

Version 4.0.2 (November 23 1999)
- Various cleanups [syl & herve].
- Shorter headers in CVS repository, but complete for release
  thanks to script for submission
- Added compare_dominance and compare_is_dominated in predicates_on_points
- Added Iso_cuboid_3
- Rewrote the body of PlaneC3<R>::transform() for Borland C++
- Added id()-filters for comparaisons of kernel objects, only when there is
  substantial computation before first exit point. For instance, when comparing
  plane, has_on (expensive is called), therefore I compare id()s first;
  on the other hand, comparing spheres compares center.x() first, which is
  likely to exit, so comparing id()s not a good investment.

Version 4.0.1 (October 28 1999)
- Filter related typo in kernel_ftC3.h [Sylvain]
- Changed cmp_signed_dist_to_planeC3() to cmp_signed_dist_to_directionC3()
  and related has_...(). [Syl]
- Optimized cmp_signed_dist_to_planeC3(5 points) [Syl].
- Cartesian/distance_predicates_3.h cleanup [Syl].
- Changed //CGAL_NO_FILTER_BEGIN&END to per predicate /*CGAL_NO_FILTER*/ [Syl].

Version 4.0 (October 21 1999)
- Cosmetic changes (indentation) for cgal-submit scripts
- Other than that, seems ready for CGAL 2.1

Version 3.6.4 (October 21 1999)
- Update for CGAL/Arithmetic_filter/predicates/kernel_ftC3.h [Sylvain]

Version 3.6.3 (October 12 1999)
- Reverted the typename R::FT in *.C to typename Classname<R>::FT [Geert-Jan]
  Should now work on M$VC++ as well because of that change
- Will work on egcs 1.1.2 once direction.vector() is changed to
  to_vector() everywhere in CGAL (pending decision).

Version 3.6.2 (October 11 1999)
- Fixed projection_lineC3 that led to bug of version 3.6.1

Version 3.6.1 (October 7 1999)
- Various predicates and constructions cleanups and speedups [Sylvain].
- Added projection_lineC3 and point_on_line as constructions on lines
- Changed name of Direction::vector to Direction::to_vector
- Changed targets in the makefile (using .PHONY)
- Cosmetic changes (notably some typename R::FT)
BUG: Assertion fails in _test_cls_line:102, but I have to submit it
TODO: Correct it (emergency!)

Version 3.6 (September 28 1999)
- Changed printing of Aff_transformations to look like C2
- Changed composition of Aff_transformations to better scheme, at
  representation level : before, each transformation was converted to its
  general_form and composed; now two translations composed yield a
  translation.

Version 3.3.5 (September 22 1999)
- Corrected class Identity to class Identity_transformation

Version 3.3.4 (September 16 1999)
- Use the new CGAL_CFG_TYPENAME_BUG
- Added Monique's predicate coplanar_orientation
- Fixed some missing std:: for cerr
- Avoid using <CGAL/predicate_classes_3.h> in Tetrahedron_3.C

Version 3.3.3 (September 9 1999)
- Renamed the script to spare the work for Geert-Jan
  (otherwise clash with C2)
- nice arithmetic: 3.3.3.3 on 9/9/99

Version 3.3.2 (September 9 1999)
- Michael Hoffmann: The declarations of friend functions like
  _general_transformation_composition have to precede their friend declaration
  (at least on mips).  
- corrected TetrahedronC3::operator==() with the correct definition

Version 3.3.1 (September 2 1999)
- Added headers to *.C so that Utrecht cant complain

Version 3.3 (September 3 1999)
- The typename added in 3.2.3 crashes VC++, hence the #define typename for VC++

Version 3.3 (September 2 1999)
- The typename added in 3.2.3 crashes VC++, hence the #define typename for VC++

Version 3.2.6 (September 2 1999)
- removed #warning which is not standard-compliant and crashes on M$VC++

Version 3.2.5 ((September 2 1999)
- Forgot include/CGAL/Cartesian/Aff_transformation_3.h

Version 3.2.4 ((September 2 1999)
- Changed all the typename R::FT into typename ClassC2<>::FT
  for M$VC++

Version 3.2.3 (September 2 1999)
- added needed typename in all <CGAL/Cartesian/*.C>
  indeed, Class_3<R>::Subclass needs a typename qualifier for MIPSPRO 7.3
  although it worked with the other compilers

Version 3.2.2 (September 2 1999)
- fixed include files that still included <CGAL/...C2.h>
  [worked with symlinks, but not in releases newer than 2.1-I-13]

Version 3.0 (August 26 1999)
****EXTENSIVE CHANGES -- enough to warrant a new 3.0 release*****
- new <CGAL/Cartesian/...> subdirectory
  predicates_on_ftC3.h put into <CGAL/predicates/kernel_ftC3.h>
  basic_construction_ftC3.h put into <CGAL/constructions/kernel_ftC3.h>
- new scheme by Michael Hoffmann, which assumes partial specialization
- temporary scheme by Stefan Schirra, which does not assume it
- Michael' scheme by default, use -DCGAL_CFG_NO_ADVANCED_KERNEL for Stefan's
  design
  (requires $CGAL/test/NewKernel, which can be found in CGAL-3.1-I-x , x>=12)
- each file Class_3.h is not separated into Class_3.h (interface declaration)
  and Class_3.C (method definitions) for easier inclusion of all *.h before *.C
- each file Class_3.h can now be included independently of the others and of the
  representation class (as long as the template parameter R defines the other
  classes in the kernel)
****IMPORTANT: please note
- for now, while we still have two versions, two scripts (create_symlinks and
  remove_symlinks) are included which have to be run before the test suite.
  when using Michael's design. (Nothing to be done for Stefan's design!)
  This is to prevent inclusion of the wrong files *C3.h and *_3.h
  (now we want to include <CGAL/Cartesian/*_3.h> instead of *C3.h)
- in order to test Stefan's design, one needs the test/NewKernel directory
  when this is added to the internal release, this directory will disappear
****BUGS FIXES: in addition, since 2.1.6
- gcc 2.95 compliant (hopefully conform to the standard)
- added std:: for endl (suggestion by Stefan Schirra)
