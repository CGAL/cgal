------  CGAL 2.2 is out ---------

Version 4.58 on 13 September 2000
- Last fix was not correct.  Try this one...

Version 4.57 on 10 September 2000
- Workaround for M$VC++, min/max.

Version 4.56 on 6 September 2000
- Renamed data member _inf and _sup to inf_ and sup_ for standard compliance.

- Moved extern "C" declaration outside namespace CGAL for M$ VC++.

Version 4.54 on 1 September 2000
- Renamed Interval_base::overlap() to do_overlap().
- Fixed min/max issue for VC++ in the test-suite.
- G++ on x86 now uses an asm() instead of a statement-expression + volatile
  for stopping compiler optimization.  It's faster, doesn't warn, and works
  with 2.96.
- Removed the default copy ctor and assignment ctor for the intervals.  This
  did not show any difference on orientation() with G++ 2.9[56].
- Removed warning in include/bench_generic.h with G++ 2.96.
- Moved the constant propagation stoppers just where needed instead of in the
  constructors : faster (but not pretty...).
- src/Interval_arithmetic.C:FPU_empiric_test() doesn't use "volatile" anymore,
  this should please KCC (and Stefan :).
- CygWin now uses an inline assembly for the buggy sqrt().
- Filtered predicates are now "static" for compilers not supporting partial
  specialization (CGAL_CFG_MATCHING_BUG_2), i.e. M$VC++.

Version 4.53 on 20 August 2000
- Make the adaptative static filters kind of work again.

  compare, abs and square, for M$ VC++.
- Qualified min and max by std:: for doubles.
- Moved Interval_base to its own file Interval_base.h.
- Moved Protect_FPU_rounding<> to _FPU.h.

Version 4.49 on 21 June 2000
- Fixed a bunch of namespace issues.
- Interval_nt is now a template class.
- Template parameter "Protection" of Filtered_exact is now a bool.
- The filtered predicates now use Protect_FPU_rounding, and the 2 dynamic
  versions are merged.  They could become nice function-try-blocks if GCC
  produced working code for them !!!

Version 4.48 on 15 June 2000
- Removed obsolete (and buggy) references to
  CGAL_CFG_NO_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT_SPECIFICATION.
- Interval_nt operations boosted with Protect_FPU_rounding().

Version 4.47 on 13 June 2000

Version 4.42 on 4 May 2000
- Added maintainer file.

Version 4.41 on 4 May 2000
- Added the assembly files for the IRIX workaround, and removed them from the
  clean target in src/Interval_arithmetic/makefile.
- Updated predicates for release 2.2-I-15.

Version 4.40 on 13 March 2000
- Added KCC/Sun support.
- Updated predicates for release 2.2-I-8.

Version 4.39 on 22 November 1999

- Fix the test-suite for VC++ without LEDA.

Version 4.37 on 11 November 1999
- Removed stupid Borland warning.

Version 4.36 on  7 November 1999
- Added C9X standard compliant rounding mode functions.
- Changed the enums FPU_cw_near... to macros CGAL_FE_TONEAREST...

Version 4.35 on  7 November 1999
- Replaced the macros CGAL_IA_SMALLEST (resp LARGEST) by static data members
  Interval_nt_advanced::Smallest (resp Largest).

Version 4.34 on  3 November 1999
- The script now recognizes the per predicate marker /*CGAL_NO_FILTER*/.
- Added an exact converter from double to Quotient<Gmpz>, so that
  Filtered_exact<double, Quotient<Gmpz> > works.
- Added missing includes in tst0.C.

Version 4.33 on 28 October 1999
- New filters:
  - Comment out the re-adjustment stuff.  The bound only grows now.
  - Add counters per predicate: "number_of_failures" and "number_of_updates".
  - Restricted_double is now a typedef for double, unless
    CGAL_IA_CHECK_RESTRICT is defined.
- Workarounds for Borland:
  - initialize the FPU mask correctly so that we don't get useless FPE.
  - it doesn't have correct IEEE comparisons -> is_valid() workaround.

Version 4.32 on 22 October 1999
- Enable the sqrt workaround for Cygwin/GCC too.
- New flag CGAL_IA_NO_INLINE which makes static instead of inline the
  operator* and operator/ over intervals.  It reduces code size and can speed
  up algorithms which use large predicates (but slow down the others).

Version 4.31 on 20 October 1999
- Removed Lazy_exact_nt.C from the test-suite (it's experimental stuff).
- New experimental filter stuff is now protected with
  "#ifdef CGAL_IA_NEW_FILTERS" in the code, to protect against VC++ failures.
- Hopefully it's ready for release 2.1 now ! :)

Version 4.30 on 19 October 1999
- Added one more missing header.
- Documentation updates: new flags CGAL_IA_NO_X86_OVER_UNDER_FLOW_PROTECT and
  CGAL_IA_DONT_STOP_CONSTANT_PROPAGATION.
- Constant propagation stopping is on by default, and has a new implementation
  for GCC which should be zero-cost thanks to __builtin_constant_p() :-).
- Put all operators on Interval_nt* friend instead of member, and got rid of
  the particular version for doubles.
- Finally got rid of Interval_nt::bound_t, as well as Double_IEEE.h.
- New file src/Interval_arithmetic/workaround_4_ms.c that defines a C function
  to compute sqrt(double).  The problem is that it must be compiled _with_
  optimization.  I ship the .obj too.
- force_ieee_double_precision() does the same things on VC++ and Borland, as
  on Linux/x86.
- Don't submit test files for the experimental stuff [yet].
- Lazy_exact_nt<> is now supposed to work ;)

Version 4.29 on 13 October 1999
- Added headers to the automaticaly generated static_infos files.

Version 4.28 on 13 October 1999
- Formatting changes.
- Removed "inline call before definition" warning detected by MipsPro.
- Added #include<float.h> for Borland.
- Added parenthesis around double computation to prevent MipsPro from changing 
  expression computation order...
- Removed convert_to<Interval_nt>().  This was useless and broke MipsPro.
- is_valid() workaround for MipsPro.
- Removed qualifier "throw(...)" of overlap_action(), it speeds things up on
  GCC.

Version 4.27 on 12 October 1999
- Fixes for Visual C++.  Most tests pass correctly now.
- New file "KNOWN_PROBLEMS" (in CVS, not submitted) that describes all
  IEEE related problems found in this package, as well as the workarounds.

Version 4.26 on 11 October 1999
- New class Double_IEEE (in Double_IEEE.h), which is a wrapper for a double,
  but with corrected operators so that it's IEEE 754 compliant (enough).
- Replaced lot's of .inf() and .sup() by ._inf and ._sup, using friend
  functions.  Hopefully it works... faster.
- Remove special version of operator*(IA, double) and operator/(IA, double).
  They were faster than the normal one, but not that used, and potentially
  risky.
- Put overlap_action() private. 

Version 4.25 on 11 October 1999
- Borland version of the rounding mode changes.

Version 4.24 on 10 October 1999   [ not submitted ]
- New class Lazy_exact_nt<> (in a preliminary state).
- Replaced CGAL_CFG_NO_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT_SPECIFICATION by
           CGAL_CFG_NO_PARTIAL_TEMPLATE_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT_SPECIFICATION or
	   CGAL_CFG_MATCHING_BUG_2 where appropriate.
- More Visual C++ fixes.

Version 4.23 on 7 October 1999
- New file include/CGAL/Arithmetic_filter/dispatch.h which contains the list
  of #include<> for the overloaded predicates, so that they are automatically
  included.
- Added <sign_of_determinant.h>, <Regular_triangulation_ftC3.h> and
  <Regular_triangulation_rtH3.h> to the list of filtered files.
- Removed references to CGAL_IA_NO_WARNING and CGAL_IA_NO_EXCEPTION, I think
  it's not useful.  Documentation updated.
- Removed Static_adaptative* and fused it in Filtered_exact<CT, ET, Static>.
- Full template is now:
  template < CT, ET, Type = Dynamic, Protection = Protected,
             Cache = No_Filter_Cache >
- New subdirectory and files Arithmetic_filter/static_infos/* that contains
  the definition of the static variables.  It is sourced by
  src/Interval_arithmetic.C.
- The 4 types of filter are now mostly ready.
- Simplified #if/#else/#elif stuff in _FPU.h, it should not break anything...
- Changed ccClass to ccClassTemplate in the doc, at Susan's request.
- predicates_ftC[23].h -> predicates/kernel_ftC[23].h.
- Removed examples/ directory.  Put the script in scripts/.
- Optimize is_valid(Interval_nt).

Version 4.22 on 2 August 1999
- New class Static_filter_error (in Static_filter_error.h) that helps
  computing static errors for static filters.
- New class Restricted_double, which is a double with restricted
  functionnality.
- New filtering scheme Static_adaptatif_filter [not 100% ready yet].
- Added predicates/sign_of_determinant.h to the list of parsed files.
- Added missing "template <>" to keep MipsPro 7.3 happy.
- New function "FPU_CW_t FPU_empiric_test()" used by expensive checks.
- Replaced CGAL_IA_DEBUG by expensive checks.

Version 4.21 on 20 July 1999
- Removed the buggy [1;-1] interval, users just have to write good code.
- New flag (disabled by default) -DCGAL_IA_STOP_CONSTANT_PROPAGATION, that
  stops the constant propagation done by the compiler.
- New FPU_get_and_set_cw() function.
- Big rewrite of the Perl script.
- CGAL_DONT_NEED_FILTER replaced by C++ comments //CGAL_NO_FILTER_BEGIN {END}.

- Documented Interval_nt_advanced::number_of_failures.
- Documented .exact(), .interval() and .value().

Version 4.19 on 6 July 1999
- The script now locally (in the produced file) defines
  "CGAL_DONT_NEED_FILTER", so the user can conditionnaly exclude some code
  in the produced file with "#ifndef CGAL_DONT_NEED_FILTER".  For example,
  some predicates that don't need to be filtered because they are already
  exact (e.g. lexico*).
- Fix for MipsPro.
- New function force_ieee_double_precision(), that sets the correct IEEE
  double precision on Intel only.
- CygWin compiles.

Version 4.18 on 30 June 1999
- Cleaned up _FPU.h, no more CGAL_*ASSEMBLY* macros, using GNU libc macros
  on Linux/PPC (x86 keeps the old asm() for compatibility with libc5).
- _FPU.h ported to M$ VC++, though it needs testing.
- Removed obsolete lower_bound() and upper_bound().
- CGAL_IA_FORCE_TO_DOUBLE() revised on __i386__, it should be slightly faster.
- Removed the template ctor for Filtered_exact<>.
- Added "std::" where missing.

- Updates the other specialization files.

Version 4.16 on 24 June 1999
- Added specializations for the regular triangulation predicates.
- The script now adds "CGAL::", so that it works for the predicates
  outside namespace CGAL.
- IO operators are now in libCGAL, not inlined anymore.
- Preliminary not-working-yet Linux/PowerPC support contributed
  by Pierre Angelier.
- Removed the old FPU_set_rounding_to_{zero|nearest|...} functions.

Version 3.8 on 20 April 1999
- Fixed small bugs.
- Updated documentation.

Version 3.7 on 15 April 1999
- Partial workaround for lack of partial specialization of the predicates.
- New template parameter "Filter_Cache" to Filtered_exact<CT,ET> to allow
  caching of the conversion to intervals (default is off).

Version 3.6 on 15 April 1999
- Final (hopefully) workaround for the rounding modes on IRIX.
- Workaround for lack of convert_to<target>(source), replaced by
  convert_from_to(target(), source).

Version 3.5 on 1 April 1999
