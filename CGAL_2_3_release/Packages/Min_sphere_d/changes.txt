Changes from 1.2:

    - added copy constructor and assignment operator in CGAL_Min_sphere_d
    - documentation has additonal `Guidelines and Hints' section now
    - default traits class files get included in Min_sphere_d.h now
    - testfiles changed accordingly (removed explicit traits class inclusion)
    - the d-dim Points are no longer maintained in the MinSphere package,
      they have been taken over by Stefan
    - testfiles include hack to suppress MIPS-linkage conflict warnings

Changes from 1.4:

    - added missing doc-file smallest_enclosing_spheres.tex
    - Problems with test programs on 64 Bit not addressed, because
      they are apparently due to a bug in leda_integer that got
      fixed for LEDA 3.7. 

Changes from 1.5:
    - renamed long_description.txt into changes.txt

Changes from 1.6:
    - bug in CGAL_DACd and CGAL_DAHd fixed (there was an undefined
      d, and the code was only working because in all test programs
      there was a d at global scope)
    - test programs changed: d renamed to D to find possible other hidden
      undefined d's (there were none)

Changes from 1.7:
    - static cast replaced by standard-conform enum conversion
    - package name changed from MinSphere to Min_sphere_d to be consistent
      with the other optimization packages

Changes from 1.8:
    - added some explicit assignment operators in order to deal with an
      egcs internal compiler error. 
    - changed inclusion order in testfiles: now leda_rational is included
      last, so basic is included before (seems to be important for some
      reason)

Changes from 1.9:
    - namespace CGAL introduced
    - Rep_distinguisher removed (old SunPro hack) 
    - Distinguishing between representation dependent optimisation spheres
      goes via specialization over the Rep_tag now, and no longer via the
      Rep_distinguisher 
    - CGAL_CFG_NO_MEMBER_TEMPLATES flag removed (assume that all compilers
      support it now). 
    - d-dim default data accessor is now representation indepenedent, but
      needs the begin- and end-iterators of the d-dim points (which have
      also newly been introduced)
    - added a class NT_rep_traits<Rep_tag, NT> to extract FT and RT from
      a number type, depending on the representation (needed by the Min_sphere) 

Changes from 1.10:
    - g++2.8.1 supporting directive CGAL_STD inserted in derived classes
    - testfiles: checking routines are in verbose mode now
    - documentation: CGAL-prefix removed

Changes from 1.11:
    - corrected main manual page: traits type R (old design) replaced by
      Rep_tag and NT.

Changes from 1.12:
    - output of random seed in testfiles added, in order to be able to
      reconstruct possible problems
    - documentation fixed (removed inconsistencies related to new traits
      class design). 

Changes from 1.13:
    - bug in pivoting routine fixed
    - files changed for Visual C++: partial specialization removed

Changes from 2.1:
    - minor fixes (std:: added in istream, ostream, syntax errors for
      M$ fixed

Changes from 2.3:
    - minor fixes; further std:: added, drand48 removed from example, 
      CGAL_BLABLA_SPEC added (according to Dima's remarks), endl added
      to sphere output test (to avoid messing up the buffer).  

Changes from 2.4:
    - CGAL_BLABLA_SPEC added also to 2- and 3-d test programs (forgot this
      before). 

Changes from 2.5:
    - Third parameter in Min_circle constructor call added
    - Lines over 80 chars fixed
    - testfiles now only do something if LEDA is used (to avoid 'n' in
      the test suite)

Changes from 2.8:
    - MSC warning for xclocnum problem added
    - empty demo dir removed.

Changes from 2.9:
    - unterminated string constant fixed

Changes from 2.10:
    - msvc message pragma replaced for nonexistent #warning

Changes from 2.15:
   - manual rewritten to new style;
   - a couple of std:: added
   - exmple program improved (using-directives removed).

Changes from 2.25:
   - concept names fixed in documentation

Changes from 2.26:
   - Susan moved Optimisation_ref directory up one level
