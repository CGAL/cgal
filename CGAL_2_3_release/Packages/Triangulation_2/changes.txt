Ver 4.0 (18 August 1999)
A new version of triangulation based on a new version of 
the triangulation data structure with a more coherent representation 
of degenerate 0-dimensional and 1-dimensional triangulations.
From the user point of view this new version should mostly
achieved backward compatibility. The main changes concern the iterators
on the faces, edges and vertices of the triangulation. 
They now come with two flavours : the "Finite" iterators iterate only on finite 
features while the "All" iterators iterate on all (finite or infinite) features
of the triangulation. Old iterator types and functions are still present for
backward compatibility.

Ver 3.6 (14 April 99)
fixed a bug
Make the testsuite run with g++ 2.8.1.
However the problen of compare() is not quite settled.
The test suite runs with g++ 2.8.1 because it uses either
a special test_traits which does not use compare()
or the euclidean traits with gmpz arithmetic.
The examples do not run because they use euclidean traits with  double
and then the clash of compare() appears

Ver 3.5 (9 April 99)

Added a demo for triangulations and Delaunay triangulations and examples.
There is still no demo, nor examples, nor testsuite

(to come soon). 
The dual functions (asking for Voronoi dual) dont work with the terrain traits class
(CGAL_Triangulation_euclidean_traits_xy_3) and the like.

Ver 2.0 (Sep 1998)
A new version of the triangulation package.
The triangulation  classes are now implemented along a three levels structure
analog to the scheme used in the polyhedron package and in the planar map package.

From the user point of view, the main changes reside in the following fact :
the triangulation classes (CGAL_Triangulation_2, CGAL_Delaunay_triangulation_2,
CGAL_Constrained_triangulation_2 etc.) are now templated with two parameters
(a geometric traits class and triangulation data structure class).

The test_suite concerns only the classes CGAL_Triangulation_2 and CGAL_Delaunay_triangulation_2.
The other triangulation classes CGAL_Regular_triangulation_2 and CGAL_Constrained_triangulation_2
have not yet been thoroughly tested.

- Updated documentation, include files were wrong
- added typename in triangulation_print_OFF.h

Ver 1.20 (23 Jun 1998)
- changed CGAL_orientation(FT ...) to CGAL_orientationC2(FT ...)
  in euclidean_traits_*_3 [due to a change in C2 package]
- changed ==(Point,Point) to traits().compare(Point,Point)
  This is due to the comparison of points not being the same as
  the == operator, e.g. for Euclidean_traits_3 (== checks x,y,z
  coordinates, but triangulation expects only x and y)
- re-added copy constructor to CGAL_Pointer

Ver 1.19 (19 Jun 1998)
- added value_type to allow back_inserter(Triangulation &)
- changed doc for bug in example files and added include directives
- reformatted doc completely, so that it is nicer.

Ver 1.18 (30 Apr 1998)
- added demo/ to package (was not present as a mistake)

Ver 1.17 (21 Apr 1998)
- added #include <CGAL/predicates_on_pointsC2.h>
  in Triangulation_euclidean_traits_[xyz]*_3.h which made the 
  test suite failed on tst27, tst37 and tst39
- add Delaunay::dual(Face), dual(edge)
- corrected bug in Face::remove()
- added types Line, Ray, Direction to traits classes
- added copy constructor to CGAL_Pointer
- moved back test/ExamplesTriangulation into examples/Triangulation
- fixed examples so that they return 0 (and the test suite works)
- added demo/ to package
- added Inventor_stream.h into demos, so that points3D can compile
- added two demos (voronoi and crust)

Ver 1.16 (11 Mar 1998)
- added handles in Triangulation_euclidean_traits_[xyz]*_3.h
- changed #include's in Triangulation_euclidean_traits_[xyz]*_3.h
- moved examples/Triangulation into test/ExamplesTriangulation
- moved doc_tex/basic/* into doc_tex/basic/Triangulation (for Geert-Jan's
  scripts)
- edited documentation

Ver 1.15 (26 Feb 1998)
- fixed the _xy euclidean traits classes and tst27, tst37
- removed the input in examples, so that they can be run in the testsuite

Ver 1.14 (25 Feb 1998)
- introduced separation between demo and examples 
- fixed the examples

Ver 1.13 (17 Feb 1998)
- added operator<<(..., Constrained_Triangulation ...)
- added documentation in the new format (doc_tex/basic)
- added documentation in html format (doc_html/basic/Triangulation)

Ver 1.12 (12 Feb 1998)
- modified CGAL_CFG_ flags
- added typenames, CGAL_NULL_TEMPLATE_ARGS, and other compiler helps
- added leda_color (for LEDA-3.6)
- corrected a few bugs and fixed the test suite
- straightened for g++ 2.8.0
- There still is a bug with Constrained_triangulation, we're working on it.
  For now, we release the code, the documentation, and the examples, but it
  is not yet in the test suite.

Ver  1.11 (19 Dec 1997)
- CGAL_Pointer<>::pointer() renamed to ptr() to avoid name clash with
     typedef T* CGAL_Bidirectional_circulator_base<T,.,.>::pointer
- Handles introduced in class Triangulation_2
- class Triangulation_2, Delaunay_triangulation_2
- traits classes Euclidean_traits_2, Euclidean_traits_xy_3, yz_3, and xz_3
