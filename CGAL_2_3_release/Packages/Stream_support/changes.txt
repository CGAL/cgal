2.3 (06 Mar 1999)

     Bug-fixes, now successfully and tested with egcs g++.

2.2 (05 Mar 1999)

     Bug-fixes.

2.1 (05 Mar 1999)

     This package has been renamed from Support_LK to Stream_support.
     Timer.h and Real_timer.h are separated in their own package to 
     reflect that they have its own chapter in the manual.
     CGAL/IO/window_stream_xy_3.h has migrated to the Window_stream
     package maintained by Stefan Schirra.

1.18 (07 Oct 1998)

     Minor internal changes in Verbose_ostream (w.r.t. copy semantic).

1.17 (23 Jul 1998)

     The iterator helper functions for the stream support are only
     defined if CGAL_CFG_NO_ITERATOR_TRAITS is set. Otherwise we rely
     on iterator traits.

1.16 (25 Jun 1998)

     Bug fix in the test program. The buffer was not terminated properly
     after writing the point into it. Demo adapted to new leda_window.

1.15 (03 Jun 1998)

     Basic support with include/CGAL/basic_lk.h removed.

1.14 (23 May 1998)

     Istream_iterator changed to conform to the C++ standard of input
     iterators, i.e. it stores the current value internally. In addition,
     it supports now an end-of-stream condition.

1.13 (24 Mar 1998)

     iterator_category fixed for Ostream_ and Istream_iterator.
     Symbolic constants for CGAL_BIG_ENDIAN and CGAL_LITTLE_ENDIAN
     changed in their semantics. Functions for even and odd renamed
     to CGAL_is_even and CGAL_is_odd.

1.12 (05 Mar 1998)

     CGAL_assert_equal_types( const T&, const T&) added.

1.11 (01 Mar 1998)

     Constants for little endian and big endian machines introduced.

1.10 (05 Feb 1998)

     Reorganized TeX files for the manual and minor changes in the manual.

1.9 (30 Jan 1998)

     New cgal_test script.

1.8 (05 Jan 1998)

     Tested with egcs. New subsections with \ccSeeAlso. Include file 
     protection as provided with the script. Includes now the TeX 
     documentation for the support library. Includes new package field
     in the header. Compliant to recent organisational conventions that 
     the examples directory gets tested and that there is a new demo
     directory.

None of this package was available in CGAL 0.9.
