These programs illustrate the functions available in CGAL that perform 
partitioning  of polygons in 2 dimenions.  The results are displayed in
a LEDA window.

The contents of this directory are:

   approx_convex_demo.C        
   greene_approx_convex_demo.C  
   optimal_convex_demo.C   
   y_monotone_2_demo.C      
      programs that display various partitionings of a single, given polygon 
 

   partition_2_demo.C
      interactive program that allows the user to input a polygon with the
      mouse, generate a random polygon, or read a polygon from a file
      and computes patitionings of a polygon using each of the four
      partitioning functions.  The user can then choose which partitions
      to see along with the original polygon.  

   makefile -- makefile for the programs in this directory

   data/
      a directory containing input files for partition_2_demo. The file
      _last contains the polygon that was last partitioned.  If it exists,
      it is read when the program is started.  The format of an input file
      is:
         #pieces  (== 1)
         #vertices <list of vertices>

      NOTE: The input files provided are for use with the Cartesian kernel.

   include/
      typedefs.h   -- file of typedefs for the CGAL types used
      polygon_io.h 
      polygon_io.C -- utility functions for input and output of polygons 
                      through a LEDA window

   output/
      a directory to which partition_2_demo writes files that contain the
      partition polygons produced.  The file names are of the following form:
      <input file>.<suffix> where <suffix> is one of
          "approx_cvx"     -- approximately optimal convex partition using 
                              triangulation, 
          "greene_approx"  -- approximately optimal convex partition using
                              y-monotone partition (Greene's algorithm)
          "opt_cvx"        -- optimal convex partition using dynamic programming
          "y_mono"         -- y-monotone partition
