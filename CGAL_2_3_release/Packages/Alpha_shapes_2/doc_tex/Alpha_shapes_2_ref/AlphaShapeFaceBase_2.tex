\ccDefinition


\ccRefines
\ccc{TriangulationFaceBase_2}.


\ccCreationVariable{f}
\ccTypes

\ccNestedType{Interval_3}{A container type to get (and put) the three special values 
($\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$) associated with an alpha shape edge.}

\ccNestedType{Coord_type}{A type to hold a coordinate type class. 
The type must provide a copy constructor, assignment, comparison
operators, negation, multiplication, division and allow the
declaration and initialization with a small integer constant
(cf. requirements for number types). An obvious choice would be
coordinate type of the point class.
\ccPrecond Let's us precise that \ccc{Coord_type} has to be the same as the one used by
\ccc{Gt}, already used by the underlying triangulation \ccc{Dt}, and by
her face base \ccc{Df}.} 

\ccCreation

\begin{ccAdvanced}

\ccConstructor{AlphaShapeFace_2();}{default constructor.}
\ccGlue
\ccConstructor{AlphaShapeFace_2(void* v0, void* v1, void* v2);}{constructor setting the incident vertices.}
\ccGlue
\ccConstructor{AlphaShapeFace_2(void* v0, void* v1, void*  v2, void* n0, void* n1, void* n2);} 
{constructor setting the incident vertices and the neighboring faces.}

\ccHeading{Access Functions}
\ccMethod{Interval_3 get_ranges(const int& i);}
{returns the interval associated with the edge indexed with $i$, which contains
three alpha values
 $\alpha_1 \leq \alpha_2 \leq \alpha_3$, such as for
$\alpha$  between $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$, the edge indexed with $i$ is
attached but singular, 
for $\alpha$ between $\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$, the edge is regular, and for $\alpha$
greater than $\alpha_3$, the edge is interior.}
\ccMethod{Coord_type get_alpha();}
{return the alpha value, under which the alpha shape contains the
face.}

\ccModifiers

\begin{ccAdvanced}

alpha values
