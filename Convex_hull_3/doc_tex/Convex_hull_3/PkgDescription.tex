\ccPkgSummary{This package provides functions 
for computing convex hulls in three dimensions as well as functions
for checking if sets of points are strongly convex or not. One can
compute the convex hull of a set of points in three dimensions in one
of three ways: using a static algorithm, using an incremental
construction algorithm, or using a triangulation to get a fully
dynamic computation.}

\ccPkgDependsOn{All algorithms produce as output a \ccRef[3D Polyhedron]{Pkg:Polyhedron}. 
                The dynamic algorithms depend on \ccRef[3D Triangulations]{Pkg:Triangulation3}}
