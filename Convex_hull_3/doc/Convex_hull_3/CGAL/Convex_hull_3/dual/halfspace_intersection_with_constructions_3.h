\brief computes the intersection of the halfspaces defined by the planes contained in the range [`begin`, `end`). The result is stored in the polyhedron `pm`.
If `origin` is given then it must be a point strictly inside the polyhedron. If an interior point is not given then it is computed using the function `halfspace_intersection_interior_point_3()` based on solving a linear program and thus is slower.
This version constructs explicitly the dual points using the convex hull algorithm parametrized with the given traits class.

Halfspaces are considered as lower halfspaces, that is if the plane equation is \f$ a\, x +b\, y +c\, z + d = 0 \f$ then the corresponding halfspace is defined by \f$ a\, x +b\, y +c\, z + d \le 0 \f$ .

\pre The value type of `PlaneIterator` and the point type of `origin` must come from the same \cgal Kernel.
\pre if provided, `origin` is inside the intersection of halfspaces defined by the range `[begin, end)`.
\pre The computed intersection must be a bounded convex polyhedron.

\tparam PlaneIterator must be an input iterator where the value type is a model of the
        concept `Kernel::Plane_3` and this plane type must come from the same kernel as the point type.
\tparam PolygonMesh must be a model of `MutableFaceGraph`.
\tparam Traits must be a model of the concept `ConvexHullTraits_3`.
