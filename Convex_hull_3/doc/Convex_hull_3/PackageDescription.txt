The function `convex_hull_3()` computes the convex hull of a given set of 
three-dimensional points.
 
Two versions of this function are available. The first can be used when it 
is known that the result will be a polyhedron and the second when a 
degenerate hull may also be possible.

\cgalPkgDesc{This package provides functions  for computing convex hulls in three dimensions as well as functions for checking if sets of points are strongly convex or not. One can compute the convex hull of a set of points in three dimensions in two ways: using a static algorithm or using a triangulation to get a fully dynamic computation.}

A subset \f$S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3 \f$ is convex if for any two points `p` and `q`
in the set the line segment with endpoints `p` and `q` is contained
in \f$S\f$. The convex hull of a set \f$ S \f$ is the smallest convex set containing
\f$ S \f$. The convex hull of a set of points `P` is a convex
polytope with vertices in `P`.  A point in `P` is an extreme point
(with respect to `P`) if it is a vertex of the convex hull of `P`.

\cgal provides functions for computing convex hulls in two, three
and arbitrary dimensions as well as functions for testing if a given set of
points in is strongly convex or not.  This chapter describes the functions
available for three dimensions.

## Assertions ##
The assertion flags for the convex hull and extreme point algorithms
use `CH` in their names (<I>e.g.</I>, `CGAL_CH_NO_POSTCONDITIONS`).
For the convex hull algorithms, the postcondition
check tests only convexity (if not disabled), but not containment of the
input points in the polygon or polyhedron defined by the output points.
The latter is considered an expensive checking and can be enabled by
defining `CGAL_CH_CHECK_EXPENSIVE`.
