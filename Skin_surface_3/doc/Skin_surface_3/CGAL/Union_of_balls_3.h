\ingroup PkgSkinSurface3Ref

The `Union_of_balls_3` is used to represent a skin surface with shrink
factor equal to one, which is the boundary of the union of the input
balls. This case is handled separately since the mixed complex is
equal to the power diagram, which has a much simpler structure.

The template argument must be a model of the concept
`SkinSurfaceTraits_3`, which means that it provides the
predicates to construct a regular triangulation of the weighted
points.
