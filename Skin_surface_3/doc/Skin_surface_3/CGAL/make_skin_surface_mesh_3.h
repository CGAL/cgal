\ingroup PkgSkinSurface3Ref

constructs a mesh of the skin surface defined
by the weighted points and the shrink factor.

The function `make_skin_surface_mesh_3()` constructs a mesh isotopic to the skin
surface based on the algorithm in \cgalCite{cgal:kv-mssct-05}. It takes
as input a range of weighted points and a shrink factor and outputs
the mesh in a `Polyhedron_3` object. A number of subdivision
steps might be applied to refine the mesh.

\tparam WP_iterator must be an input iterator with weighted points as value type.
\tparam Polyhedron must be an instance of `Polyhedron_3`.

\pre `Polyhedron::HDS` can be used as the template argument of
the `Polyhedron_incremental_builder_3<HDS>`.
