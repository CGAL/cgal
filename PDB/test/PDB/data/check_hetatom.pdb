REMARK   8 SKELETON THROUGH LINKS WITH THE FOUR PYRROLE NITROGENS               
REMARK   8 (UPPER DISTANCE LIMITS 2.9 A).  AS THE DIANA LIBRARY                 
REMARK   8 DOES NOT ALLOW THE INTRODUCTION OF METAL IONS, THE HEME              
REMARK   8 IRON WAS DEFINED AS A DUMMY ATOM, AND ITS HEXACOORDINATE             
REMARK   8 GEOMETRY ACCOMPLISHED BY IMPOSING THE APPROPRIATE UPPER AND          
REMARK   8 LOWER DISTANCE LIMITS BETWEEN THIS DUMMY ATOM AND THE                
REMARK   8 LIGAND ATOMS BY "SPECIAL COVALENT BONDS" (LINKS).  STARTING          
REMARK   8 FROM THE FOUR PYRROLE NITROGENS, THE HEME SKELETON WAS               
REMARK   8 BUILT BY DEFINING NORMAL COVALENT BONDS BETWEEN THE ATOMS.           
REMARK   8 "SPECIAL COVALENT BONDS" WERE ALSO USED TO DEFINE THE LINKS          
REMARK   8 BETWEEN THE HEME AND CYS 15 AND CYS 18.  2.1 AND 1.9 A WERE          
REMARK   8 USED AS UPPER DISTANCE AND LOWER DISTANCE LIMITS,                    
REMARK   8 RESPECTIVELY, BETWEEN THE CYSTEINE SULFUR AND THE A-CARBON           
REMARK   8 OF THE CORRESPONDING HEME THIOETHER SUBSTITUENT.                     
REMARK   8 THE LINK BETWEEN MET 61 AND THE HEME IRON WAS PERFORMED BY           
REMARK   8 APPLYING A "SPECIAL COVALENT BOND" WITH UPPER AND LOWER              
REMARK   8 DISTANCE LIMITS OF 2.45 AND 2.25 A BETWEEN THE SULFUR                
REMARK   8 METHIONINE ATOM AND THE IRON ATOM AND OF 2.9 AND 3.2 A               
REMARK   8 BETWEEN THE SULFUR METHIONINE ATOM AND THE FOUR PYRROLE              
REMARK   8 NITROGENS.  DEFINING THE APPROPRIATE BONDS AS ROTATABLE,             
REMARK   8 THE HEME SUBSTITUENTS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO ASSUME ALL                
REMARK   8 POSSIBLE CONFORMATIONS.  ANALOGOUSLY, THE HIS 19 RING AND            
REMARK   8 THE MET 61 SIDECHAIN CAN CHANGE THEIR ORIENTATIONS WITH

REMARK   9                                                                      
REMARK   9 NOE CONSTRAINTS. A TOTAL NUMBER OF 1776 EXPERIMENTAL NOESY           
REMARK   9 CONSTRAINTS WERE ASSIGNED AND INTEGRATED WHICH WERE THEN             
REMARK   9 TRANSFORMED IN UPPER DISTANCE LIMITS USING THE PROGRAM               
REMARK   9 CALIBA.  OF THESE, ONLY 1278 RESULTED TO BE MEANINGFUL AND,          
REMARK   9 THEREFORE, HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY DIANA.  A TOTAL           
REMARK   9 OF 498 REMAINING CONSTRAINTS WERE FOUND TO BE IRRELEVANT             
REMARK   9 FOR THE CALCULATION (I.E. EITHER NO CONFORMATION OF THE              
REMARK   9 POLYPEPTIDE CHAIN COULD VIOLATE THEM OR THEY CORRESPOND TO           
REMARK   9 FIXED PROTON-PROTON DISTANCES).  INITIALLY NO                        
REMARK   9 STEREOSPECIFIC ASSIGNMENT WAS AVAILABLE AND PSEUDOATOMS              
REMARK   9 WERE USED.  THE NOE CONSTRAINTS CORRESPOND TO AN AVERAGE             
REMARK   9 OF 20.0 NOES PER RESIDUE AS INPUT FOR THE DG CALCULATIONS            
REMARK   9 AND OF 14.5 ACCEPTED EXPERIMENTAL CONSTRAINTS PER RESIDUE.

REMARK  10 DISTANCE GEOMETRY. THE DISTANCE GEOMETRY CALCULATIONS                
REMARK  10 (DIANA, REDAC) WERE INITIALLY PERFORMED USING 1776                   
REMARK  10 EXPERIMENTAL DISTANCE CONSTRAINTS.  500 STRUCTURES WERE              
REMARK  10 INITIALLY CALCULATED.  IN LATER STEPS, 20 EXPERIMENTAL               
REMARK  10 ANGLE CONSTRAINTS BASED ON THE 3J(NH-HA) VALUES WERE                 
REMARK  10 INCLUDED IN THE STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS.  36 STEREOSPECIFIC           
REMARK  10 ASSIGNMENTS OF DIASTEREOTOPIC PROTONS WERE OBTAINED                  
REMARK  10 THROUGH THE USE OF THE PROGRAM GLOMSA.  AT THE FINAL                 
REMARK  10 STAGES OF THE DISTANCE GEOMETRY CALCULATIONS, HYDROGEN               
REMARK  10 BOND CONSTRAINTS WERE ALSO INVOLVED.  THIS APPROACH IS               
REMARK  10 WIDELY USED, AS FURTHER INFORMATION INVOLVING EXCHANGEABLE           
REMARK  10 PROTONS HELPS IN BETTER DEFINING THE SOLUTION STRUCTURE.             
REMARK  10 THE GEOMETRIC CRITERIA THE DEPOSITORS CHOSE FOR THE                  
REMARK  10 PRESENCE OF A HYDROGEN BOND REQUIRES THE PROTON-ACCEPTOR             
REMARK  10 DISTANCE TO BE LESS THEN 2.4 A AND THE ANGLE FORMED BY               
REMARK  10 THE PROTON, THE DONOR ATOM AND THE ACCEPTOR ATOM TO BE               
REMARK  10 WITHIN 350.  FOR THE MAIN-CHAIN ATOMS, THESE GEOMETRICAL             
REMARK  10 CRITERIA WERE FOUND TO BE SATISFIED FOR 15 NH/CO PAIRS               
REMARK  10 BUILDING HYDROGEN BONDS.  THE PRESENCE OF HYDROGEN BONDS             
REMARK  10 INVOLVING THESE AMIDE PROTONS WAS SUPPORTED BY THE                   
REMARK  10 EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATION THAT THE CORRESPONDING                      
REMARK  10 RESONANCES WERE STILL PRESENT IN THE SPECTRA RECORDED IN             
REMARK  10 D2O.

REMARK  11 IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD PROCEDURE OF THE DISTANCE                
REMARK  11 GEOMETRY CALCULATIONS EXTENSIVE USE OF THE REDUNDANT                 
REMARK  11 ANGLE STRATEGY (REDAC) WAS EMPLOYED FOR THE DEFINITION

REMARK  13 HEAVY ATOMS) WITH A RELATIVELY SMALL INCREASE OF THE                 
REMARK  13 PENALTY FUNCTION.  THE RMD FAMILY HAS, HOWEVER, LOWER                
REMARK  13 ENERGY THAN THE DG AND THE REM FAMILIES INDICATING THAT              
REMARK  13 IT REPRESENTS A MORE STABLE STRUCTURE.  THE REM                      
REMARK  13 CALCULATIONS LED TO A GENERAL IMPROVEMENT OF THE AVERAGE             
REMARK  13 RMSD DISTRIBUTION AND, THEREFORE, TO THE DEFINITION OF               
REMARK  13 THE STRUCTURE.  THE RMD REFINEMENTS PROVIDES A REMARKABLE            
REMARK  13 IMPROVEMENT OF THE QUALITY OF THE RESULTING FAMILY AND OF
