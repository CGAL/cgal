1.39 (10 Oct 2002)
  - replace use of CGALi::Construct template with own function object
    in Triangulation_indirect_traits (since template was removed in
    the kernel).

1.38 (12 Aug 2002)
  - replace LEFTTURN and relatives by LEFT_TURN and relatives.

-------------------------------- Release 2.4 ----------------------------------
1.37 (6 May 2002)
  - use std::vector in Rotation_tree for Borland as well (something not
    working with the std::unique call there it seems)

1.36 (3 May 2002)
  - switch back to std::vector for MSVC6 (CGALi::vector doesn't work there...)

1.35 (3 May 2002)
  - use CGALi::vector in Rotation_tree as well

1.34 (25 Apr 2002)
  - switched to use of CGALi::vector in Partitioned_polygon to see if this makes
    things work for M$

1.33 (25 Apr 2002)
  - added missing traits class to call to is_degenerate_polygon_2

1.32 (24 Apr 2002)
  - removed more .x() and .y() accesses and global function calls and updated
    the traits requirements accordingly

1.31 (18 Apr 2002)
  - removed some .x() and .y() accesses

1.30 (8 Apr 2002)
  - removed remaining <R> parameterization of point type.

1.29 (24 Mar 2002)
  - fixed remaining problems in optimal partition with collinear vertices
  - fixed some problems in the traits classes (referring to old design and
    undocumented types and such)

1.28 (19 Mar 2002)
  - fixed problems in optimal partition and greene_approx partition that
    crop up when there are collinear vertices 

1.27 (23 Jan 2002)
  - added a std:: to size_t in Matrix.h

1.26 (17 Jan 2002)
  - removed typos left over from the last change
  - remove ch_utils.h include

1.25 (5 Dec 2001)
  - changed from use of reinterpret_cast to Kernel_traits

1.24 (5 Dec 2001)
  - reverted back to list.sort() since std:sort requires random access iterators
  - removed ch_utils.h dependency

1.23 (2 Dec 2001)
  - added some CGAL prefixes to make SunPro happy
  - also changed to use of std::sort instead of sort in std::list

1.22 (26 Oct 2001)
  - fixed bug in Indirect_edge_compare for comparing edge with itself

1.21 (26 Oct 2001)
  - added missing std:: in debug statement
 
1.20 (13 Sep 2001)
  - added refresh button (necessary for Windows platforms?) to demo programs
  - commented out random polygon generation in examples; seems to be buggy

1.19 (28 Aug 2001)
  - added use of exact number type in examples

-------------------------------- Release 2.3 ----------------------------------
1.18 (31 July 2001)
  - moved Partition_2_ref directory up one level
  - renamed intro.tex file to avoid conflicts with other packages

1.17 (26 July 2001)
    minor formatting changes

1.16 (26 July 2001)
    made changes necessary to do manual split

1.15 (16 July 2001)
    fixed initialization bug in Partition_vertex_map
    changed asserts to CGAL_assertions 

1.14 (12 July 2001)
    minor fix in doc.

1.13 (12 July 2001)
    Simplified Partition_vertex_map so it does not have any circular type
    references;  this makes the Borland compiler happy
  
    Converted Partition_vertex_map to be based on a vector instead of a list
    to make the Borland compiler happy.

    Shorted names of some predicate classes

    introduced exact number types in some examples

    changed test programs so they can use the default cgal_test now.

1.12 (6 July 2001)
    Fixed many things in documentation (requirements vs. preconditions;
    added Implementation sections; included example programs instead of
    using verbatim)

    changed example programs to use a random polygon instead of a static one

    added README for example programs

    added file name in example programs

1.11 (2 May 2001)
    Fixed bugs in Indirect_edge_compare.

1.10 (1 May 2001)
    Changed traits requirements for y-monotone partition to incorporate
    the Compare_x_at_y function now available in the kernel.
    
1.9 (22 March 2001)
    Changed basis for std::stack in Vertex_visibility_graph_2 to std::list
    instead of std::deque (the default) since the latter under MSVC++ assumes
    pointers where it shouldn't (i.e., iterator_traits doesn't work).

    Changed name of template parameter from Point_2 to Point_2_ in set_valid
    for Partition_opt_cvx_edge so VC++ won't get confused.

    Made some cosmetic changes to the demos.

1.8 (12 March 2001)

    Changed Vertex_const_iterator to Vertex_iterator for Partition_vertex_map
    build() function and partition_is_valid_2() in the hopes that this will 
    fix the problem the Windows compilers have with the call to insert in
    build().

    Removed the .C files that cannot be used with VC++ because of template
    member functions.

    Fixed some warnings related to unused variables and parameters.

1.7 (8 March 2001)

    Added typedefs for Traits parameters in Partitioned_polygon_2.

    rearranged class declarations in Partitioned_polygon_2.h to please VC++
    and fixed other small bugs with const vs. non-const interators, typedefs
    for class not public.

    Changed name of Polygon_2 template parameter to Polygon in some functions
    so VC++ won't get confused with the Polygon_2 class defined elsewhere.
    

1.6 (19 January 2001)

    Fixed more problems with types and typedefs in Partitioned_polygon_2.

    Fixed small problem with introduction to reference pages in doc.
   
1.5 (8 January 2001)
   
    Moved definitions of template functions inside classes to see if 
    Borland and VC++ can deal with this better and fixed some typedefs
    causing problems with these two compilers.

    Modified documentation in accordance with suggestions from editors.

1.4 (20 November 2000)
   
    fixed bug in the cgal_test script

    Moved definitions of template functions in Indirect_edge_compare class 
    inside the class to see if Borland and VC++ can deal with this better.

1.3 (7 November 2000)
    
    changed test suite by dividing it into more programs that will take
    less time to compile and adding a compile-time flag so the same program 
    can be used for testing the homogeneous and Cartesian kernels.

    fixed(?) some bugs with template parameters for Borland

1.2 (20 September 2000)
    
    added a few missing .C files

1.1 (2 August 2000)
    
    Fixed bugs with misplaced includes for .C files, a few missing CGAL::
    for MIPS, and wrong function names in example files. 

1.0 (28 July 2000)
   
    Initial release
