Nef_2 Package: Release changes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.22 (22 July 2002)
     - fixed doc of Extended_cartesian
     - moved specialization of Polynomial operators to src to allow
       multiple inclusions without linker errors

1.21 (8 July 2002)
     - restore changes from 1.19

1.20 (8 July 2002)
     - ??? mistake that removed last change

1.19 (8 July 2002)
     - rename ASSERT macro to CGAL_NEF_ASSERT to avoid conflict with 
       other libraries' macros.

1.18 (28 June 2002)
    
     - Initialize boolean mark variable in constructors since default 
       value on MSVC is not always 'false'.

---------------------------- Release 2.4 -------------------------------

1.18 (13 May 2002)

     - Removed LEDA_MEMORY from Vertex, Halfedge, and Face. It won't 
       be used anyway, since the HDS container are allocator based.
     - Split HDS_items definition into separate classes for Vertex,
       Halfedge, Face and Items.

1.17 (08 May 2002)

     - Moved external member function definitions into class definitions
       to please VC7.

1.16 (7 May 2002)
     -  casting of Standard_RT(0) required before assignment for Borland

1.15 (2 May 2002)
     - enclose the temporary variable in a small scope to ensure it
       is destroyed earlier for SunPRO compiler

1.14 (29 Apr 2002)
     - added missing cstddef include

1.13 (26 Apr 2002)
     - removed SNIINST hack from calls in specialized operator -

1.12 (25 Apr 2002)
     - removed CGAL_*_INLINE macros that were in comments in Polynomial.h
     - make specialized operator - for int and double polynomials defined
       for MSVC only

1.11 (23 Apr 2002)
     - do not use simple interface for Borland
     - do use SNIHACK for Boralnd, which has touble distinguishing templated
       constructor from specialization
     - removed some const & for the same reason.
     - removed unneeded variable initialization
     - added missing CGAL_NTS before sign
     - added specialization of operator - for Polynomial<int> and <double>

1.10 (22 Apr 2002)
     - added function for gcd in content() to distinguish between number types
       with gcd and those without (using Number_type_traits).  Rather a hack.
     - changed back from Standard_RT to RT in Extended_homogeneous

1.9 (19 Apr 2002)
     - added some missing CGAL_NTS before gcd calls
     - added missing include of number_utils.h
     - added hacks for M$ to resolve ambiguities?

1.8 (17 Apr 2002)
     - removed test for MSVC version around certain macros so the
       macros get defined for VC7 as well.

1.7 (16 Apr 2002)
     - added typedef (and typename) of Has_gcd tag to get rid of problem for 
       g++ 3.0

1.6 (11 Apr 2002)

     - Removed HalfedgeDS_using_in_place_list.h and HalfedgeDS_default.h
       in include/CGAL/Nef_2. They are not used anymore (there counterparts
       in include/CGAL are used in general except for MSC).

1.5 (24 Mar 2002)

     - added iterator access function documentation
     - converted to use of CGAL_NTS gcd function 

1.4 (22 Mar 2002)

     - Changed conditional compilation for _MSC_VER to 
       _MSC_VER <= 1200 (i.e. VC6). We'll try to get the general
       design to work with VC7.

1.3 (19 Mar 2002)

     - PM_overlayer.h: changed use of Partition to Union_find.

1.2 (19 Mar 2002)

     - added some CGAL_LEDA_SCOPEs to make conversion to LEDA version
       with namespaces
     - added missing CGAL:: in demo program
     - minor changes to please SunPro CC

1.1 (18 Mar 2002)

     - include/CGAL/HalfedgeDS_default_MSC.h: Fixed bug in copy
       constructor and assignment operator to copy pairs instead of 
       single halfedges. Bug reported by Xiangmin Jiao and fixed in 
       original HalfedgeDS 3.4 (15 Jun 2001).
     - include/CGAL/HalfedgeDS_default_MSC.h: Added use of 
       CGAL_ALLOCATOR, otherwise the default allocator used in
       In_place_list that could be incompatible with new/delete
       would have created problems.

0.9 (9 Sept 2000)

     initial release
