%%%                        This file defines a macro, \path|...|,
%%%                        similar to LaTeX's \verb|...| macro, that
%%%                        sets the text in the typewriter font,
%%%                        allowing hyphen-less line breaks at
%%%                        punctuation characters.
%%%
%%%                        The default set of punctuation characters is
%%%                        defined as
%%%
%%%                        \discretionaries |~!@$%^&*()_+`-=#{"}[]:;'<>,.?\/|
%%%
%%%                        However, you can change it as needed, for
%%%                        example
%%%
%%%                        \discretionaries +@%!.+
%%%
%%%                        would assign to it the set @ % ! . which
%%%                        commonly occur in electronic mail addresses.
%%%
%%%                        The delimiter characters surrounding the
%%%                        arguments to \discretionaries and \path
%%%                        will normally be a punctuation character not
%%%                        found in the argument, and not otherwise
%%%                        significant to TeX.  In particular, backslash
%%%                        cannot be used as a delimiter.  In the rare

%%%
%%%                        \specialpathdelimiterstrue
%%%
%%%                        This practice is not recommended, because TeX
%%%                        then runs about four times slower while it is
%%%                        typesetting \path\...\ requests.
%%%                        \specialpathdelimitersfalse is the normal

%                          The \path Macro
%
% An early prototype of this code which was developed by Nelson H. F.
% Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu> used a recursive macro to peel off one
% character at a time, then with a nest of \ifx statements, test for
% each punctuation character, and if one is found, insert discretionary
% linebreaks in the form of \- or \penalty0.  While this usually works,
% it is not entirely satisfactory, because the nested \ifx statements
% are ugly, and the recursion can exhaust TeX's macro stack for
% arguments longer than about 30 characters.
%
% A second version by NHFB built upon the ideas used by the LaTeX
% \verb|...| macro; this was mostly successful, but was flawed by its
% inability to handle at least the three characters ^ [ ], by loss of
% use of @ for naming internal private macros, and by its inability to
% allow the set of characters at which breaks are permissible.
%
% The problem was then passed off to Philip Taylor, who wrote this third
% version which fully solves the problem.  Phil therefore gets the
% author credit in the file header above.  [Gee, thanks !  ** Phil]
