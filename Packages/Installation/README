This distribution of CGAL includes:

   auxiliary/         - directory containing additional things distributed 
                        with CGAL but not part of the library (in particular,
                        the GNU multi-precision number type). The gmp library
                        has its own license.
   cgal_config.bat    - configuration file for the Windows platforms
   CHANGES            - file recording the history of changes for the library
   config/            - directory containing several test programs used in
                        installation and configuration and into which 
                        configuration files will be written during installation
   demo/              - a directory containing many demo programs for the
                        library's various packages.  These programs produce
                        visual output.  Thus, for most you must have either 
                        LEDA or libCGALwin installed (see the INSTALLATION 
                        file).  Others programs require geomview, which is 
                        available from www.geomview.org
                        Makefiles are provided for all programs and project 
                        files for MSVC 6.0 IDE (experimental) are provided 
                        for many.
   doc_html/          - a directory containing the installation manual in
                        HTML format

   examples/          - a directory containing programs illustrating the 
                        library's functionality.  These programs do not produce
                        visual output.
                        Makefiles and project files for MSVC 6.0 IDE

                        platform.
   install_cgal       - the script with which you can install CGAL
   INSTALLATION       - file containing information about the installation
                        process
   lib/               - directory in which the CGAL libraries will be 
                        installed

                        libraries (to be used only if you know what you are
                        doing; normally one should use install_cgal)
   README             - this file
   scripts/           - directory containing some useful scripts for CGAL
                        programmers
