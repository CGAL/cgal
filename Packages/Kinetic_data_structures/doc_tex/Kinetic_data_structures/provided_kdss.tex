\section{Provided Kinetic Data Structures}
\label{sec:provided_kdss}

Along with the framework, we provide several already implemented kinetic data structures. They currently are 
\begin{description}
\item[\ccc{CGAL::KDS::Sort<Traits>}] maintain a list of points sorted by x-coordinate.
\item[\ccc{CGAL::KDS::Delaunay_triangulation_2<Traits,Visitor, Triangulation>},\ccc{CGAL::KDS::Delaunay_triangulation_3<Traits,Visitor, Triangulation>}] maintain the Delaunay triangulation of a set of two or three dimensional points.
\item[\ccc{CGAL::KDS::Regular_triangulation_3<Traits, Visitor,
Triangulation}] maintain the regular triangulation of a set of waiting three dimensional points.
\item[\ccc{CGAL::KDS::Enclosing_box_2<Traits>}, \ccc{CGAL::KDS::Enclosing_box_3<Traits>}] restrict points to stay within a box by bouncing them off the walls.
\end{description}

Using all of the kinetic data structures is quite similar, so we only
present the case of Delaunay triangulation in two dimensions. See the
respective reference pages and demos for details of using the other
data structures.
