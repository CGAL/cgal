     - Fixed 'emplate' typo that shows with MSVC only.

3.9 (21 Jun 2001)

     - Attempt to fix bug in hds_prog_compact.C. 
     - New naming scheme for concepts.
     - New kernel traits introduced.
     - Changed name of HalfedgeDS_items.h to HalfedgeDS_items_2.h.
     - Revised example files and doc.

3.8 (19 Jun 2001)

     - Changes in the doc.

     - Fixed example code inclusion in the doc.
     - Fixed compilation bugs with Base_base types in halfedge bases.

3.6 (17 Jun 2001)

     - changed erase_all() to clear() for HalfedgeDS concept.

3.5 (15 Jun 2001)

     - hanged filename to avoid upper/lower-case conflict of 
       HalfedgeDS_[Ii]tems.tex.

3.4 (15 Jun 2001)

     - Added missing reference pages in 
       doc_tex/basic/HalfedgeDS/HalfedgeDS_ref/.
     - Added missing *.gif files for the reference pages.
     - HalfedgeDS_using_in_place_list.h: Fixed bug in copy  
       constructor and assignment operator to copy pairs instead of 
       single halfedges. Bug reported by Xiangmin Jiao.
     - Made assignment of empty vertex or face handles while copying
       explicit. Was relying previously on proper default initialization.
     - Fixed warnings in the test suite about unused variables.

3.3 (27 Sep 2000)

     - Fixed warning for ill-formed main() declaration. 
     - Fixed problems with Base_base:: in halfedge_base classes that
       were reported with g++ -pedantic. 
     - Fixed problems with point() and normal() access in the workaround
       for missing partial specializations of the vertex_base and 
       face_base classes.
     - Changed the handling of iterators in HalfedgeDS_using_list.
       The HalfedgeDS_iterator_adaptor relies now on a local static 
       variable to create a unique std::list::iterator. The previous
       solution was using an initializer with 0, which isn't standard
       compliant, and it failed now with the std::list::iterator and KCC.
       The new solution uses zero-initialization of static variables,
       Section 3.6.2, 6.7, and 8.5 of the C++ Standard.

3.2 (21 Sep 2000)

     Converted to std:: and CGAL:: namespaces and using new std 
     header file name convention. The manual pages are separated into 
     user manual pages and reference manual pages, but still in one 
     chapter. Tested with g++ and MipsPro 7.3.

3.1 (26 Mar 1999)

     Complete redesign. Incompatible to previous versions. The design
     provides much more flexibility and can support planar maps and
     other data structures more easily. The class interface has been
     changed to be more in line with STL container classes and the 
     few dependencies on the geometry (point type) are removed.
