ABSTRACT. This is a short guide to installing and using CGAL with
Windows compilers using native tools, that is, no extra add-on for the
development environment, such as Cygwin, is needed.  The present
document concerns mainly the MSVC 6.0 (Visual C++) compiler and
IDE. Command-line interface for Borland C++ compilers (versions 5.4 and 5.5)
is very similar and is briefly described, as well.

This document addresses Windows-specific issues of using CGAL. General
questions of CGAL programming are considered in the CGAL Manual.

1. Introduction

1.1. What is supported.

The present CGAL release provides a basic support for the following
compiler: MSVC 6.0, Borland C++ Builder 4 (with underlying Borland C++
5.4), Borland C++ 5.5 and 5.5.1.  This guide mainly concerns MSVC 6.0.
Using Borland compilers with CGAL is very similar is briefly described
in the Appendix.

Interfaces to arbitrary precision arithmetic packages (GNU MP and
the corresponding part of LEDA) are supported. A precompiled GNU MP
library is included in the distribution.

A 2D visualization via LEDA Window and 3D visialization via
LEDA GeoWin is supported.


1.2. What is not (yet) supported.

MSVC 5.0 is not supported.  Also, Intel's ICL compiler, known as a
"drop-in replacement for VC++" is not supported, although we might
decide to support it at some point.

Interface to CLN does not work for MSVC, as CLN cannot be compiled
into an MSVC compatible library.

CGAL 3D visualization on Windows is provided via LEDA-dependent
GeoWin.  Geomview is not ported to Windows, thus using it with CGAL is
not an option.  Also, the openGL-based CGAL viewer that interfaces via
FLTK (or Mesa) library is being developed.


1.3. What is needed.

In order to use CGAL with MSVC, you need MSVC command line tools
installed and working. Certain familiarity with using Windows command
prompt and these tools is assumed. A reasonable  amount of system
resources, that is enough memory to run large compilations (64 Mb on
NT4.0)  and about 15MB of disk space, is required.

It is highly recommended that you have a recent (at least 4.0) version
of LEDA installed. Most of the CGAL demos would not work without LEDA.

The procedure is known to work on "mainstream" MS Windows platforms,
such as Windows 2000, NT 4, 95 and 98. 

1.1. Getting CGAL

The easiest way to download CGAL is via the CGAL homepage: 
http://www.cs.uu.nl/CGAL/
and go to the `Software' section. 
Follow the instructions on this page to obtain your copy of the
library. 

Download the file called CGAL-2.2.zip and decompress it into a
suitable directory.  For the latter, either your web browser is able
to interact with a decompression program like WinZip 
(see http://www.winzip.com), or you can save
the zip-file onto the disk and decompress it using unzip.exe program
that can be downloaded, for instance, from
http://www.itribe.net/virtunix/

Do *not* use directory names that have spaces in them for the
installation path.
A subdirectory called CGAL-2.2 will be created. 
The full path to it is referred as CGALROOT in the sequel.
CGALROOT contains the following subdirectories: 


directory  contents  

auxiliary  packages that can optionally be used with CGAL  
	   in particular, GMP
config	   configuration files for install script  
demo	   demo programs (some of them need LEDA, geomview, 
			 OpenGL or other third-party products)  
doc_html   documentation (HTML)  
doc_pdf	   documentation (PDF)  
doc_ps	   documentation (Postscript)  
examples   example programs  
include	   header files  
lib	   object libraries  
make	   files with platform dependent makefile settings  
stlport	   STL header files used with MSVC
src	   CGAL library source files
winutils   configuration files and utilities for Windows installation


CGAL has interfaces to a number of rather important 3rd party
packages, that provide, in particular, arbitrary precision arithmetic,
and visualization. On Windows these packages are LEDA and GNU MP (also
known as GMP).  GMP is supported by default; see Sect. 5 for details.
LEDA configuration is described below.


2. Initial customization.

Open a Command Prompt (on Win9* it is called MS-DOS Prompt) window.
(do not try using a Cygwin bash window. Should you like to use Cygwin,
 use the usual bash script install_cgal instead. See the "generic"
 Installation manual.)
Change to CGALROOT and run the batch file cgal_config.bat at the
prompt.  This script will set the appropriate makefiles for
subsequent compilation.

cgal_config.bat accepts 4 parameters.

 1.		the compiler type (msc (or msvc))

 2. (optional)	compiler options (to enable debugging and/or threads
		support)

 3. (optional)	LEDAROOT (the location where LEDA lib files are installed)

 4. (optional)	the location where LEDA header files are installed.
		If omitted, it is assumed to be LEDAROOT\incl.

Typically, assuming that LEDA is installed in 
k:\LEDA-4.1-991117, they would look as follows:

one would run at the command prompt:

K:\cgal\> cgal_config msc k:\LEDA-4.1-991117

Otherwise, if LEDA header files are not in LEDAROOT\incl, one would run, say,

K:\cgal\> cgal_config msc k:\LEDA-4.1-991117\msvc k:\LEDA-4.1-991117\incl

It is assumed that 3. (LEDAROOT) and 4. do not have names with spaces.

Running cgal_config.bat without parameters prints out the detailed
options list (in particular, for 2. above).


3. Building the library, examples and demos

Change to CGALROOT and run make_lib.bat at the command prompt. Namely,

K:\cgal\> make_lib

builds the library with the compiler/options specified in 2.
For other settings, one would have to reconfigure (see 2.) and recompile
(same as for LEDA).

K:\cgal\> make_examples

compiles and links the examples and

K:\cgal\> make_demos

compiles and links the demos. 

Note that the amount of disk usage for the executables and temporary
files can be considerable, up to several hundereds megabytes for all 
the executable, object and debug files.

Examples and demos can also be built on per directory, or even on per
executable basis.  Each examples\ and demo\ subdirectory contains a
file makefile.mak that is an MSVC nmake makefile.  For instance,
change to CGALROOT\demo\Point_set_2 and type "nmake -f makefile.mak
all" to build all the examples.  Typing "nmake -f makefile.mak
ps_test1" will build the particular demo ps_test1.

The corresponding executable(s) then can be run as usual, from the
command prompt, or via Explorer.

Note that demos requiring LEDA would not work if CGAL was configured
without LEDA support.


LEDA be compiled and used with LEDA_STD_HEADERS flag on. CGAL uses
new-style C++ standard conformant headers (the ones that do not have
.h- suffix), while LEDA can work with both styles. Mixing these styles
is a strict no-no for MSVC.  Before compiling LEDA, edit the file
LEDAROOT\incl\LEDA\system.h and set #define LEDA_STD_HEADERS there.


4. Developing for CGAL with MSVC

Here we give some hints on the use of CGAL with native MSVC tools; C++
language issues/troubleshooting and the use of CGAL with Cygwin are
covered in the generic Installation manual.

The most important issue is the following.  CGAL uses C++ STL
(Standard Template Library) quite extensively.  To resolve many C++
Standard compliance problems of the native MSVC STL, we chose to use a
drop-in replacement for it, STLPort (see http://www.stlport.org).  We
have customized STLPort, version 3.2.1, to partially support
std::iterator_traits template of STL.

For this to work, the compiler should have STLPort subdirectory first
in its search path.  This issue is taken care of in the makefiles
generated.  Customization of IDE is described in Sect 4.2 below.


4.1. Using nmake makefiles.

Simply adapt a makefile.mak from an examples\ or demos\ subdirectory.
This means changing the target "all" and changing the targets that
create executables (look in the subsection "target entries" there).
For instance, you would like to create an executable demo_beta.exe
from a C++ source file demo_beta.C.  Then your makefile, that would
include the "main" makefile makefile.mak in CGALROOT would have

all: demo_beta

demo_beta: demo_beta.obj
	$(CGAL_CXX) $(LIBPATH) $(EXE_OPT)demo_beta demo_beta.obj \
	$(LDFLAGS)

and a "suffix rule" that describes creation of an object file from a
.C - file, e.g.

.C.obj:
	$(CGAL_CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(OBJ_OPT) $<

Extra compiler and linker options are to be specified by changing
macros CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS, respectively.

One way to specify the "main" makefile is by using environment
variable CGAL_MAKEFILE to specify the full path to makefile.mak in
CGALROOT.

Probably such a makefile can also be used for "custom build" via an
IDE, although we never attempted this ourselves.


4.2. Using MSVC IDE

The compiler/linker options used to build the CGAL library should
match those used for the project. This can be done by
selecting "Project/Settings...", the "C/C++" section,
"Code Generation" category, and choosing the right
library in "Use run-time library:"

Single-Threaded			ml (or no option)
Multi-threaded			mt
Multi-threaded DLL		md
Debug Single-Threaded		mld
Debug Multi-threaded		mtd
Debug Multi-threaded DLL	mdd

Further necessary customization is as follows.
We hope that the forthcoming automatic installation will simplify
these elaborated procedures.

4.2.1. Customizing compilation.

Additional include directories (in the right order!) and preprocessor
definitions have to be specified.  We assume that either CGAL_ROOT is
an (already defined) environment variable (and then the include and
library paths can be entered as shown), or $(CGAL_ROOT) must be
replaced by the corresponding full path to the CGAL installation.

Select "Project/Settings...", the "C/C++"
section, "Preprocessor" category. Add (in the following order)

   $(CGAL_ROOT)\stlport
   $(CGAL_ROOT)\include\CGAL\config\msvc
   $(CGAL_ROOT)\include
   $(CGAL_ROOT)\include
   $(CGAL_ROOT)\auxiliary\wingmp\gmp-2.0.2

to "Additional include directories:".
It is very important that $(CGAL_ROOT)\stlport appears first
in the list in "Additional include directories:"; otherwise a bunch
of ugly compiler error messages is guaranteed.

If LEDA is used, don't forget to add 
   $(LEDAROOT)\incl
to "Additional include directories:".

Add CGAL_USE_GMP to "Preprocessor definitions:".
If LEDA is used, also add CGAL_USE_LEDA and LEDA_PREFIX there.


Should your source file(s) have non-MSVC-standard suffices,
(like all the CGAL source files, by the way)
add /TP to options "Project Settings" in the "C/C++" section,
"Preprocessor" category.


4.2.2. Customizing linking.

Additional library directories have to be specified.
Select "Project/Settings...", "Link" section, "Input" category. Add 
	 CGAL.lib
	 gmp.lib
in "Object/library modules:" list.
If LEDA is used, also add there
   libP.lib 
   libG.lib 
   libL.lib

If LEDA Window is used, also add there
   libW.lib
In addition, make sure that you link against the system libraries
  user32.lib gdi32.lib comdlg32.lib shell32.lib advapi32.lib
(usually IDE has them already on the list).

If LEDA Geowin is used, one should as well add
   libGeoW.lib 
   libD3.lib
to "Object/library modules:.


5. GNU MP support

A pre-compiled for MSVC, using Cygwin GNU C compiler and GNU assembler, 
static object library gmp.lib is located in 
CGALROOT\auxiliary\wingmp\gmp-2.0.2\msvc
and the corresponding header file gmp.h in
CGALROOT\auxiliary\wingmp\gmp-2.0.2

It was created using M.Khan's CYGWIN-specific patches to GNU MP 2.0.2,
that are available from
http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/ and then
slightly modified (by adding a few routines, like random, and creating a
separate MSVC-compiled library that does I/O of the GMP numbers.)  It
was checked that all tests that come with GMP distribution pass.  See
CGALROOT\auxiliary\wingmp\gmp-2.0.2\msvc\src for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Appendix. Using Borland compilers with CGAL

Here we describe the differences with MSVC installation described
above.

Initial customization is very similar to the one for MSVC.
The only difference is the choice of options for the compiler.
Run
	cgal_config bcc [leda-dirs...]
or 
	cgal_config bcc d [leda-dirs...]

for debug version of the library.

Building the library, examples and demos using make_lib, make_demo
and make_examples is the same.

Note that the makefiles created are for nmake, an MSVC tool; batchfiles use
BCB make tool with "-N" compatibility option. We did not try to use
them without this option.
That is, instead of "nmake" above one should use "make -N".

Customizing BCB IDE should not be hard. The same general procedure of
customizing compilation and linking applies, with an important
difference that the platform-specific library paths end on bcc rather
than on msvc, and that stlport include directory should NOT be added
at all.

GNU MP support for Borland compilers is preliminary, and can be
considered beta, as well.  A precompiled static library is located in
CGALROOT\auxiliary\wingmp\gmp-2.0.2\bcc

It is built by configuring GMP to be compiled with BCB, and then
compiled, with BCB. No assembler routines are used, 
Thus do not expect it to be fast.
(There are no source code of them in Intel format available.
 GMP uses AT&T assembler format instead. Unfortunately there is no
 assembler available that can generate BCB object format, OMF, from the
 AT&T format source code. Nor a convertor from COFF to OMF
 that works with GAS output is available.)
