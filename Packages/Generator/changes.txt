     provided with the script. Includes now the TeX documentation for 
     the support library. Includes new package field in the header.

     directory gets tested and that there is a new demo directory.

Changes compared to CGAL 0.9:

     Full redesign of the initialization of a point with double 
     coordinates. The generation of more complex geometries like 
     segments and triangles has been solved using Join_iterator
     instead of specialized functions. 3D Point generators added.
