Subject: CGAL 3.1 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body: 

We are pleased to announce the release 3.1 of CGAL, the Computational Geometry
Algorithms Library.  


Besides improvements of existing packages this release offers
the following new algorithms and data structures.

 o 2D Segment Voronoi Diagram

   An incremental algorithm for Voronoi diagrams of segments in the plane
   under the Euclidean metric. The Voronoi edges are arcs of straight lines
   and parabolas. In case the input segments intersect, the Voronoi diagram 
   of their arrangement is computed.


 o 2D Conforming Triangulations and Meshes

   An implementation of Shewchuk's algorithm to construct conforming
   triangulations and 2D meshes.


 o 3D Boolean Operations on Nef Polyhedra

   A data structure representing 3D Nef polyhedra, a boundary representation
   for cell-complexes bounded by halfspaces that supports Boolean operations
   and topological operations in full generality including unbounded cells,
   mixed dimensional cells (e.g., isolated vertices and antennas). Nef
   polyhedra distinguish between open and closed sets and can represent
   non-manifold geometry.
   Also available are planar Nef polyhedra embedded on the sphere.


 o dD Box Intersection Testing and Reporting

   A new efficient algorithm for finding all intersecting pairs for large
   numbers of iso-oriented boxes. Typically these will be bounding
   boxes of more complicated geometries. Useful for (self-) intersection
   tests of surfaces etc.


 o 2D Snap Rounding

   An algorithm for converting arbitrary-precision arrangements of segments
   into a fixed-precision representation. An Iterated Snap Rounding algorithm 
   is also available in which each vertex is at least half the width of a
   pixel away from any non-incident edge.


 o 2D and Surface Function Interpolation

   Several algorithms for scattered data interpolation from measures of a
   function on a set of discrete data points.  The package further offers
   functions for natural neighbor interpolation.

The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data 
structures and algorithms. The CGAL library contains:
o The Kernel providing basic geometric primitives such as points, vectors,
  lines, predicates for testing things such as relative positions of points,
  and operations such as intersections and distance calculation.
o The Basic Library, a collection of standard data structures and geometric
  algorithms, such as convex hull, (Delaunay, Regular, Constrained)
  triangulation, Voronoi diagrams, planar map, arrangements, polyhedron,
  smallest enclosing sphere, multidimensional query structures...
o Interfaces to other packages, e.g. for visualization, and I/O, and 
  other support facilities.

(GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1).  
The Basic Library is distributed under the terms of the QPL Open Source
license (Q Public License v1.0).
