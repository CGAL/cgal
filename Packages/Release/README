This is what you need to do to create a release:

For the library:

Let <release_dir> be the directory in which you plan to build the release.

      1.  update the CHANGES file in this package to correspond to this
          release
      2.  copy the latest internal release to <release_dir>
      3.  unpack it and rename the directory CGAL-M.m
      4.  edit the script release_scripts/make_public_release as instructed
          in the script
      5.  cd CGAL-M.m
      6.  run the script release_scripts/make_public_release to
               Remove the test directory.
               Remove developer_scripts dir
               Remove doc_tex dir
               Remove winutils dir
               Remove examples/*/cgal_test, demo/*/cgal_test
               Find all .C and .h files and collect them in a file
               Edit include/CGAL/version.h
                   #define CGAL_VERSION ...
                   #define CGAL_VERSION_NR ...
      7.  Copy Release/CHANGES

For the manuals:

      1.  Check out the package Manual from the CVS server and follow the
          instructions in the INSTALL file
      2.  cd Manual
      3.  install_manual_files ?.?-I-??  (number of latest internal release)
      4.  follow the directions in Manual/README to create the
          manuals (but don't install them yet)
      5.  in the CGAL-M.m directory, create doc_ps, doc_pdf and 
          doc_html/installation directories to hold the installation
          doc. Copy the appropriate files from directory
          Manual/CGAL-M.m_doc_tex/installation to these directories.

      6.  For the HTML version in CGAL-M.m/doc_html (NOT in the Manual
          directory), do the following bit of editing:
             remove the navigation links to bibliography, index and title;
             remove the files title.html and manual_index.html, to_html.log.

Package the code:
      1.  In directory <release_dir> do
             find CGAL-M.m -exec touch 01221530 {} \;
           in order to touch all files (Here the date/time  Jan 22, 15:30 was 
           used as an example)
      2.  Make CGAL-M.m.tar.gz with tar and gzip and CGAL-M.m.zip with zip.
           gtar zcf CGAL-M.m.gtar.gz CGAL-M.m
           tar cf CGAL-M.m.tar CGAL-M.m
           gzip CGAL-M.m.tar
           zip -r CGAL-M.m.zip CGAL-M.m
      3.  The .zip file for the code needs to be repackaged for use with
          InstallShield.  Contact the person in charge of Windows support
          (currently Radu Ursu <rursu@geometryfactory.com>).

For the web pages:
      1.  edit the following web pages (at least)
             Web_pages/news.html            
             Web_pages/in_progress.html            
             Web_pages/download/download.html            
             Web_pages/download/license.html            
             Web_pages/home.html            
             Web_pages/releases.html            
             Web_pages/platforms.html
           change release number in:
           (edit and use Manual/script/rename_version)
             Manual/web_pages/doc_html/frameset/panel*.html 
             Manual/web_pages/doc_html/html_tar.html
             Manual/web_pages/doc_ps/index.html
             Manual/web_pages/doc_pdf/index.html
      2.  update the cgi-bin/cgal_download.pl script to add the new release,
          goes then to /www/pub/cgi-bin/www.cgal.org/
      3.  Perhaps update the download/CGALWin directory with new versions
          of the library for new platforms. [obsolete since CGAL 3.0, Lutz]

Install everything:
      1.  install the manual (and include files) in 
          /www/pub/www.cgal.org/Manual using "make install"
      2.  copy the .tar.gz and .zip files for the library and
          the documentation to /ftp/pub/outgoing/CGAL/
            (can be done with "make pack" for the documentation)
      3.  zip the individual .ps files for the documentation using
          make dest_zip_ps
      4.  install the new web pages, i.e., make a cvs commit in Web_pages/,
          and a 'cvs up' in /www/pub/www.cgal.org/
      5.  cp cgi-bin/cgal_download.pl /www/pub/cgi-bin/www.cgal.org/

      6.  [obsolete with CGAL-3.0.1 since we tag before release making, Lutz]
          tag all the packages included in the release with the new
          release tag CGAL_M_m_release and create a branch tag with
          the name CGAL_M_m_branch.
	  cvs -z9 co All -rcurrent_submission
	  cd All
	  cvs tag CGAL_M_m_release
	  cvs tag -b CGAL_M_m_branch
	  Notes : (1) it takes a while,
	          (2) you need write access to all packages.

Then finally ...
      7.  announce the release (see announcement directory)
