2.8 (17 July 2001)
Added do_intersect for two circles.

2.7.1 (19 June 2001)
Added a  #endif

2.7 (22 May 2001)
Implemented segment segment intersection without making use of collinear_has_on.

2.6.5 (1 May 2001)
Small change to suppress a warning.

2.6.4 (2 March 2001)
Adapted testfiles slightly (unsetf instead of setf)

2.6.3 (6 July 2000)
+ Added operator== and operator!= to Straight_2_

----
2.6.2 (19 June 2000)
+ Qualified calls of 'abs' and 'sign' by CGAL_NTS.

----
2.6.1 (18 May 2000)
+ Qualified calls of sign with CGAL::

----
2.6 (17 Apr 2000)
+ Made a few chnges to Straight_2.

-----
2.5.3 (12 April 2000)
+ Changed leading underscores in trailing underscores.

-----
* 2.5.2 *
+ Added CGAL:: prefix before do_intersect in test program; MSVC does not
  have Koenig lookup and needs it.

-----
* 2.5.1 *
+ Removed a number of unneccessary break statements in
  Segment_2_Segment_2_intersection.h

-----
* 2.5 *
+ Altered implementation of do_intersect for segment segment case.
  This version is much faster (factor 20 to 30 with Cartesian<double>)
  and is accurate when the segment is degenerated to a point.

-----
* 2.4 *
+ Replaced const casting by mutable keyword.

-----
* 2.3 *
+ Intersections involving bounding boxes now include Cartesian.h.
  They are not included by <CGAL/intersections_2.h> anymore.
  Instead, there is a file <CGAL/Bbox_2_intersections.h>
+ The guards around include directives are removed (for modern compilers
  there is no increase in compilation speed, so readability prevails).

-----
* 2.2.2 *
+ cgal_test now reports diff of program output and expected output.

-----
* 2.2.1 *
+ Qualified is_finite calls with ::CGAL::.

-----
* 2.2 *
+ Replaced dir.vector() by dir.to_vector() in several places to avoid a bug in
  egcs 2.91.66 compiler.

-----
* 2.1.8 *
+ Replaced using declarations by explicit qualification in test files.
  So, instead of using std::cout; , use std::cout everywhere.

-----
* 2.1.7 *
+ cgal_test now writes to ProgramOutput* file

-----
* 2.1.6 *
+ Small change to test/cgal_test

-----
* 2.1.5 *
+ Updated all testfiles
  added int as return type for main whre necessary to avoid warnings
  added using declarations for cout, cin and ios.

-----
* 2.1.4 *
+ Added some CGAL_ prefixes to inclusion guards

-----
* 2.1.3 *
+ Adapted cgal_test and makefile in test directory to new install_cgal.

-----
* 2.1.2 *
+ Fixed a bug in template specialisation syntax.
