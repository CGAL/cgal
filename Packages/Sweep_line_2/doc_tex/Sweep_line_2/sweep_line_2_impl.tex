\section{Implementation}

The sweep line algorithm was implemented according to Bentley and
Ottmann~\cite{bkos-cgaa-97}. The implementation is robust. It supports general
curves and handles all degenerate cases, including overlapping curves,
vertical segments, and tangency between curves.

The STL $map$-container is used for the implementation of the event queue, and
the STL $set$-container is used for the implementation of the status line.
Additional containers are used to accomodate all
\ccHtmlNoLinksFrom{intersection} points for each input curve ordered from left
to right, and all the resulting subcurves for each event point. 

The complexity of this algorithm is $O(n\log{n} + k\log{n})$ where $n$ is the 
number of the input curves and $k$ is the number of
\ccHtmlNoLinksFrom{intersection} points induced by these curves.
