\section{Introduction}
% +========================================================================+
\label{PM_sec:intro}

In this chapter we introduce \ccc{planar maps} which are 
embeddings of \ccc{topological maps} into the plane.
The \ccc{Planar_map_2<Dcel,Traits>} class is derived
from the \ccc{Topological_map<Dcel>} class with additional geometric considerations
and functionalities (e.g., point location, bounding box). 
In this section we briefly review
the geometric concepts added in the planar map; the combinatorial concepts were
reviewed in Chapter ~\ref{I1_ChapterTopologicalMap}, {\em Topological Maps}.
We also describe the additional functionality of \ccc{Planar_map_2<Dcel,Traits>}
over that of \ccc{Topological_map<Dcel>}.

\section{Terms and Software Design}

   There are two template parameters, the \ccc{Dcel} which is the
   underlying combinatorial data structure and the \ccc{Traits} which
   is the underlying geometry, i.e. the number type used, the
   coordinate representation and the family of curves treated.

\paragraph{Curve:}
We will use the term {\it curve} to describe the image of a continuous
$1\!\!-\!\!1$ mapping into the plane of any one of the following: the
closed unit interval (arc), the open unit interval (unbounded curve),
or the unit circle (closed curve). In all cases a curve is non
self-intersecting. Segments, lines, rays, conic sections are examples for curves.

\paragraph{$X$-monotone curve:}
We
use a convention
that a curve $c$ is $x$-monotone if $c$ either intersects 
any vertical line in at most one point, or $c$ is a vertical
segment. 

\paragraph{Planar subdivision (planar map):}
A planar subdivision (or planar map) is an embedding of a planar 
%graph $G$
topological map $T$ 
into the plane, such that each edge of $T$ is embedded as a
bounded $x$-monotone curve and each vertex is embedded as a planar point.
% The image of a vertex of $T$ is a {\em vertex},
%and the image of an arc is an {\em edge}.
In this embedding no
%pair of edges intersect in their interiors.
edge intersects another edge interior.

A {\em face} of the subdivision is a maximal connected region of the
plane that does not contain any vertex or edge. 
We consider a face to be open, and its boundary is
formed by vertices and halfedges of the subdivision.
The halfedges are oriented around a face so that the face they bound
is to their left. This means that halfedges on the outer boundary
of a face are traversed in counterclockwise order, and halfedges on the inner
boundaries (holes) of a face are traversed in clockwise order. Halfedges 
around a vertex are also traversed in clockwise order. 

\paragraph{Maps with infinite objects (bounding boxes):}

The Planar map deals both with bounded objects, such as segments, circles.
and with infinite objects, such as lines, rays, parabolas.
For simplicity we decided that the default would be the former, e.g. bounded objects.
In order to deal with the latter, some finite representation of such infinite curves is required. The bounding box strategy supplies the required functionality to do this.

A bounding box is defined by two main aspects: its traits representation and its maintenance strategy.
The traits representation is a given shape that corresponds to a region in the plane in which we are interested at a given moment, e.g. a rectangle, a big disk, the whole plane.
The maintenance strategy, can be of many types. The strategy may be of \ccc{static} type , i.e. we are interested only in a fixed region of the plane, curves outside this region are ignored, or it may be \ccc{dynamic}, i.e. the bounding box increases or decreases while the user updates the planar map.
The strategy may be of an \ccc{open} type, i.e. the boundary of the box should not be included as curves of the map, or it may be \ccc{closed}, where this means that the boundary is a part of the planar map.

\paragraph{Point Location:}

Some of the basic operations on planar maps are queries such as ``what is the location of a point in the map?'', or ``which curve is vertically above the point?''.
These geometric queries are supplied as part of this Planar Map class, with 
several algorithms available for the user to choose from.

\paragraph{I/O functions:}
I/O functions for reading a saved planar map from the standard input, 
writing it to the standard output or drawing it to a graphic stream are also provided.
Users of I/O functions for the planar map package are required to define I/O 
operators for the curves defined in their \ccc{Traits} classes.

% %\paragraph{Sweep Line}
% %-------------------------------------------------
%   The \ccc{Planar Map with Intersections} packge contains a sweep line
%   utility. The sweep line algorithm can be used to build a planar map
%   much quicker than in an incremental way, where each curve is
%   inserted after the other. Two global functions are provided. 

%   The function \ccc{sweep_to_construct_planar_map} builds a planar map
%   as a result of the call. Mind that it is possible to call this
%   function also with an instance the \ccc{Planar_map_2} class rather
%   than an instance of \ccc{Planar_map_with_intersections_2}. If no
%   additional insertion of intersecting or non-$x$-monotone curves are
%   planned follwing the building of the map, then it would be more
%   efficient (in running time) and less demanding (in traits class
%   functionality) to use an instance of the former.

%   The function \ccc{sweep_to_produce_planar_map_subcurves} does not
%   build a planar map but rather collects the $x$-monotone pairwise
%   disjoint subcurves in a container. It is possible to tune the
%   function so that it will avoid to produce repetitions of overlapping
%   subcurves in the container or not.

%   The sweep line utility calculates intersections of curves.  The
%   \ccc{PlanarMapWithIntersectionTraits_2} concepts requires this
%   very functionality.  Thus, the sweep line functions have to use
%   traits classes that model the above concept. This is true even for
%   the case where an instance of \ccc{Planar_map_2<Dcel, Traits>} is built.

%   %See the sweep line functions reference pages for implementation
%   %details (\ccc{sweep_to_construct_planar_map}\lcTex{
%   %\ccRefPage{CGAL::sweep_to_construct_planar_map}} and
%   %\ccc{sweep_to_produce_planar_map_subcurves}\lcTex{
%   %\ccRefPage{CGAL::sweep_to_produce_planar_map_subcurves}}).

\subsection*{Functionality}

The class \ccc{Planar_map<Dcel,Traits>}  supplies the ability to maintain
a planar map. All the combinatorial entities have a geometric mapping, e.g.,
a vertex of a planar map has a \ccc{Point} data member, a halfedge has
a \ccc{X_curve} (x-monotone curve) data member, etc. In addition to the 
modifying function, namely, insertion, removal, splitting and merging, the user
can perform point location queries and vertical ray shoot queries.
For a full reference of the class (i.e its associated types,
its operations, etc.) read the \ccc{Planar_map Reference Pages}\lcTex{
(\ccRefPage{Pm_Ref_intro})}.

\end{figure}

The following program creates a planar map from five curves (see
figure ~\ref{PM_sec:example_pic}). It uses the floating-point
arithmetic interface class
(\ccStyle{Pm_segment_epsilon_traits<R>}). The first part of the
code initializes five segments. The next part inserts them into the map
and checks the validity of the map. In the last part, vertical ray
shooting is performed from the point $p$.

The output of the program is

\begin{ccExampleCode}

\subsection{Example of IO functions}
\label{PM_sec:example9}

The following program demonstrates the use of I/O functions provided for planar maps. %\ccc{Planar_map}.
First the program demonstrates a trivial use of the I/O functions: 
it defines an empty instance of \ccc{Planar_map_2}, 
reads the planar map representation text from the standard input stream, 
and then prints the resulting planar map to the standard output stream.

Second, it presents the usage of the verbose format, 
by defining \ccc{Pm_file_writer} with the verbose flag set to true, 
and then calls the function \ccc{write_pm}.
A usage of the interface of the class \ccc{Pm_file_writer} is also presented, 
by calling its function \ccStyle{write_halfedges}, which prints all the halfedges of the map.
In addition, the program presents the operators writing the resulting 
\ccc{Planar map} to a postscript file when LEDA is installed. 
The demo for the planar map package makes use of the output operator 
of \ccc{Planar_map_2<Dcel,Traits>} to a window stream  
(see at \ccStyle{<CGAL_ROOT>/demo/Planar_map/demo.C} ).   

%graphic streams in commented lines
%(The comments can be removed if the user has LEDA installed).

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Planar_map/example9.C}

The input of the program is a text file which holds the planar map representation in a special format (which is presented in the reference pages of the the \ccc{Planar Map} package. 
This representation appears as the first block in the output file.
 
%\ccIncludeExampleCode{Planar_map/example9.cin}

The output is the \ccc{Planar map} includes both formats, non-verbose and verbose. In addition the two lists 
(non-verbose and verbose) of halfedges are written.
