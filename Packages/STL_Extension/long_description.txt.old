2.7 (28 Jul 1999)

     Some missing std:: fixed. Michael Hoffmann (ETH) takes over
     the maintenance of this package with this release.

     Typos before CGAL R2.0 fixed.

2.5 (29 Apr 1999)

     in_place_list_prog.C fixed.

2.4 (12 Apr 1999)

     std:: namespace added for iterator_category().

2.3 (07 Apr 1999)

     Fixes std:: prefix for base classes to CGAL_STD:: in 
     function_objects.h. std:: namespace added for value_type()

2.2 (15 Mar 1999)

     Standard headers, std namespace and CGAL namespace.

     The Modifier_base class is separated in its own package to 
     reflect that it has its own chapter in the manual.
     copy_n is located in the CGAL namespace. In order to avoid
     name clashes, it excluded from compilation if namespaces are
     not supported, e.g. Gnu g++ 2.8.1.

     Documentation fixes: False constructor removed for Counting_iterator
     and impl. description fixed for Inverse_index.

     const iterator. Fix incorrect documented template parameter
     lists for Random_access_adaptor and Random_access_value_adaptor.
     Some internal changes to make it compile on egcs 1.1 (to work 
     around a compiler bug).

1.16 (12 Nov 1998)

     Changes in In_place_list: The iterators have been rewritten with
     fewer template parameters, which results in shorter template names.
