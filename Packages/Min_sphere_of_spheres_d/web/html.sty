% LaTeX2HTML Version 95.1 : html.sty
%
%  WARNING:  This file requires LaTeX2e.  A LaTeX 2.09 version
%	is also provided, but with restricted functionality.
%
% This file contains definitions of LaTeX commands which are
% processed in a special way by the translator. 
% For example, there are commands for embedding external hypertext links,
% for cross-references between documents or for including
% raw HTML.
% This file includes the comments.sty file v2.0 by Victor Eijkhout
% In most cases these commands do nothing when processed by LaTeX.

%%% LINKS TO EXTERNAL DOCUMENTS
%
% This can be used to provide links to arbitrary documents.
% The first argumment should be the text that is going to be
% highlighted and the second argument a URL.
% The hyperlink will appear as a hyperlink in the HTML 
% document and as a footnote in the dvi or ps files.
%
\newcommand{\htmladdnormallinkfoot}[2]{#1\footnote{#2}} 

% This is an alternative definition of the command above which
% will ignore the URL in the dvi or ps files.
\newcommand{\htmladdnormallink}[2]{#1}

% This command takes as argument a URL pointing to an image.
% The image will be embedded in the HTML document but will
% be ignored in the dvi and ps files.
%
\newcommand{\htmladdimg}[1]{}

%%% CROSS-REFERENCES BETWEEN (LOCAL OR REMOTE) DOCUMENTS
%
% This can be used to refer to symbolic labels in other Latex 
% documents that have already been processed by the translator.
% The arguments should be:
% #1 : the URL to the directory containing the external document
% #2 : the path to the labels.pl file of the external document.
% If the external document lives on a remote machine then labels.pl 
% must be copied on the local machine.
%
%e.g. \externallabels{http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/WWW/doc/tex2html/latex2html}
%                    {/usr/cblelca/nikos/tmp/labels.pl}
% The arguments are ignored in the dvi and ps files.
%
\newcommand{\externallabels}[2]{}

%
% This complements the \externallabels command above. The argument
% should be a label defined in another latex document and will be
% ignored in the dvi and ps files.
%
\newcommand{\externalref}[1]{}

% This command adds a horizontal rule and is valid even within
% a figure caption.
%
\newcommand{\htmlrule}{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The following commands pertain to document segmentation, and
% were added by Herbert Swan <dprhws@edp.Arco.com> (with help from
% Michel Goossens <goossens@cern.ch>):
%
%
% This command inputs internal latex2html tables so that large
% documents can to partitioned into smaller (more manageable)
% segments.
%
\newcommand{\internal}[2][internals]{}

%
%  Define a dummy stub \htmlhead{}.  This command causes latex2html
%  to define the title of the start of a new segment.  It is not
%  normally placed in the user's document.  Rather, it is passed to
%  latex2html via a .ptr file written by \segment.
%
\newcommand{\htmlhead}[2]{}

%
%  The dummy command \endpreamble is needed by latex2html to
%  mark the end of the preamble in document segments that do
%  not contain a \begin{document}
%
\newcommand{\startdocument}{}

%
%  Allocate a new set of section counters, which will get incremented
%  for "*" forms of sectioning commands, and for a few miscellaneous
%  commands.

%  respective counters.

\newcommand{\DumpPtr}[2]{%
\count255=\arabic{#1} \advance\count255 by \arabic{#2}
\immediate\write\ptrfile{%
\noexpand\setcounter{#1}{\number\count255}}}

%
%  Define a helper macro to dump all counters to the file.
%  The value for each counter will be the sum of the l-counter
%      actual LaTeX section counter.
%  Also dump an \htmlhead{section-command}{section title} command
%      to the file.
%

\DumpPtr{subparagraph}{lsubparagraph}
\DumpPtr{equation}{lequation}
\immediate\write\ptrfile{\noexpand\htmlhead{#2}{#3}}
\immediate\closeout\ptrfile}

%
%  Define the \segment{file}{section-command}{section-title} command,
%  and its helper macros.  This command does four things:
%	1)  Begins a new LaTeX section;
%	2)  Writes a list of section counters to file.ptr, each
%	    of which represents the sum of the LaTeX section
%	    counters, and the l-counters, defined above;
%	3)  Write an \htmlhead{section-title} command to file.ptr;
%	4)  Inputs file.tex.

% Comment.sty   version 2.0, 19 June 1992
% selectively in/exclude pieces of text: the user can define new
% comment versions, and each is controlled separately.
% This style can be used with plain TeX or LaTeX, and probably
% most other packages too.
%
% Examples of use in LaTeX and TeX follow \endinput

%
% Usage: all text included in between
%    \comment ... \endcomment
% or \begin{comment} ... \end{comment}
% is discarded. The closing command should appear on a line
% of its own. No starting spaces, nothing after it.
% This environment should work with arbitrary amounts
% of comment.
%
% Other 'comment' environments are defined by
% and are selected/deselected with
% \includecomment{versiona}
% \excludecoment{versionb}
%
% These environments are used as
% \versiona ... \endversiona
% or \begin{versiona} ... \end{versiona}
% with the closing command again on a line of its own.
%
% Basic approach:
% to comment something out, scoop up  every line in verbatim mode
% as macro argument, then throw it away.
% For inclusions, both the opening and closing comands
% are defined as noop
%
% Changed \next to \html@next to prevent clashes with other sty files
% (mike@emn.fr)
% Changed \html@next to \htmlnext so the \makeatletter and
% \makeatother commands could be removed (they were causing other
% style files - changebar.sty - to crash) (nikos@cbl.leeds.ac.uk)
% Changed \htmlnext back to \html@next...

%%% RAW HTML 
% 
% Enclose raw HTML between a \begin{rawhtml} and \end{rawhtml}.
% The html environment ignores its body
%
\excludecomment{rawhtml}

%%% HTML ONLY
%
% Enclose LaTeX constructs which will only appear in the 
% HTML output and will be ignored by LaTeX with 
% \begin{htmlonly} and \end{htmlonly}
%
\excludecomment{htmlonly}
% Shorter version
\newcommand{\html}[1]{}


%%% LaTeX ONLY
% Enclose LaTeX constructs which will only appear in the 
% DVI output and will be ignored by latex2html with 
%\begin{latexonly} and \end{latexonly}
%
\newenvironment{latexonly}{}{}
% Shorter version
\newcommand{\latex}[1]{#1}

%%% HYPERREF 
% Suggested by Eric M. Carol <eric@ca.utoronto.utcc.enfm>
% Similar to \ref but accepts conditional text. 
% The first argument is HTML text which will become ``hyperized''
% (underlined).
% The second and third arguments are text which will appear only in the paper
% version (DVI file), enclosing the fourth argument which is a reference to a label.
%
%e.g. \hyperref{using the tracer}{using the tracer (see Section}{)}{trace}
% where there is a corresponding \label{trace}
%
\newcommand{\hyperref}[4]{#2\ref{#4}#3}

%%% HTMLREF
% Reference in HTML version only.
% Mix between \htmladdnormallink and \hyperref.
% First arg is text for in both versions, second is label for use in HTML
% version.
\newcommand{\htmlref}[2]{#1}

%%% HTMLIMAGE
% This command can be used inside any environment that is converted
% into an inlined image (eg a "figure" environment) in order to change
% the way the image will be translated. The argument of \htmlimage
% is really a string of options separated by commas ie 
% [scale=<scale factor>],[external],[thumbnail=<reduction factor>
% The scale option allows control over the size of the final image.
% The ``external'' option will cause the image not to be inlined 
% (images are inlined by default). External images will be accessible
% via a hypertext link. 
% The ``thumbnail'' option will cause a small inlined image to be 
% placed in the caption. The size of the thumbnail depends on the
% reduction factor. The use of the ``thumbnail'' option implies
% the ``external'' option.
%
% Example:
% \htmlimage{scale=1.5,external,thumbnail=0.2}
% will cause a small thumbnail image 1/5th of the original size to be
% placed in the final document, pointing to an external image 1.5
% times bigger than the original.
% 
\newcommand{\htmlimage}[1]{}

%%% HTMLADDTONAVIGATION
% This command appends its argument to the buttons in the navigation
% panel. It is ignored by LaTeX.
%
% Example:
% \htmladdtonavigation{\htmladdnormallink
%              {\htmladdimg{http://server/path/to/gif}}
%              {http://server/path}}
\newcommand{\htmladdtonavigation}[1]{}
