       input (uses the LEDA traits).

Circle_arr_from_file - constructs a circle arrangement from an input
       file, some example files are given in circle_input_files/ .

Polyline_arr_from_file - constructs a polyline arrangement from an input
       file, some example files are given in polyline_input_files/.

Polyline_arr_from_mouse - constructs a polyline arrangement from window
       input. It Does not use the LEDA traits (but, of course, the LEDA
       graphic interface).

Seg_circ_arr_from_file - constructs an arrangement of circular arcs and 
       line segments from an input file. Some example files are given in
