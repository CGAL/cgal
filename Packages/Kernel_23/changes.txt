  places. However, it assumes that count is initialized to 1 in default 
  and copy constructor.

  One level of indirection has been removed.
  The code now assumes that dynamic_cast<> is supported.

2.3   -> 2.4     (19 Aug 99)

  template <class R> CGAL::Point_2 : public R::Point_2_base
  We have how in CGAL::Homogeneous, e.g.,
  typedef Homogeneous<RT,FT>           R;
  typedef PointH2<FT,RT>               Point_2_base;

  included yet

- CGAL-2.0/include/CGAL/known_bit_size_integers.h extended
  for Borland and M$ Visual C++ as suggested by Dima
- determinant.h split in determinant.h and predicates/sign_of_determinant.h
  essentially as suggested by Sylvain
- Circle_2 added to user_classe.h (as requested by Herve)
- _Vector_?_rft_wrapper removed from user_classe.h
- homgeneous.h: parameterization of class Homogeneous changed (in the spirit
  of the implementation classes *H2<FT,RT> ) 
    #ifndef CGAL_CFG_NO_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_ARGUMENTS
    template <class rt, class ft = Quotient<rt> >
    #else
    template <class rt>
    #endif
    class Homogeneous
  The flag is most likely redundant for the compilers supported by CGAL.

3.47  (14 Aug 2002)

====================== CGAL 2.4 =============================

3.46  (20 March 2002)
- removed Point_d

3.45   (20 March 2002)

- Remove obsolete #includes.

3.35   (27 September 2001)
- remove the need to have "-I../Kernel/include" in the submitted makefiles,
  by hard coding it in the #includes<> inside the test files.  This way it
  makes it clear in the test files which headers come from CGAL, and which
  come from the test-suite.
- a by product of this is that we can use the default makefiles, and so I
  added "makefile" to dont_submit.
- I added "-I../../H2/include" and similar in the makefiles, so that we can
  work more easily with our working copies (didn't you find it painful to
  have to tweak the makefiles for each submission ?).
- Fixes a buffer overflow which made SunPro 5.3 fail at run time.
