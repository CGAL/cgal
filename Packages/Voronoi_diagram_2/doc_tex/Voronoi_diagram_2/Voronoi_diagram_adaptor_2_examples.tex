\section{Examples}
\label{sec:vda2-examples}

In this section we present two examples that show how to traverse the
Voronoi diagram or how to perform point location queries.

\subsection{First example}

The following example shows how we can compute the number of connected
components of the Voronoi skeleton (this is the union of Voronoi edges
and vertices), by appropriately traversing the edges and vertices of
the Voronoi diagram using the Voronoi diagram adaptor. The algorithm
applied is a simple DFS algorithm. In the same example, the number of
bisecting arcs, bisecting half-bisectors (semi-unbounded arcs) and
full bisectors are computed.

\subsection{Second example}

The following example shows how we can perform point location using
the Voronoi diagram adaptor.
