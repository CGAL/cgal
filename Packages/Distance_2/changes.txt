============================ CGAL 3.0 ===================================

2.17 (21 October 2003)

2.16 (7 October 2003) [af]
- Added '&' to parameters

2.15 (15 September 2003)

2.11 (7 September 2003)
* bug fixes

2.10 (4 September 2003)
* Removed CGAL_WRAPs in squared_distance_utils.h
* More bug fixes

2.9 (12 August 2003)
* Even more bugfixes.

2.8 (7 August 2003)
* Bug fixes after the first step ==:>-

2.7 (7 August 2003)
A first step towards the extendible Kernel:

* All functionality is moved into namespace CGALi, in namespace CGAL
  there remain forward functions for the geometric types from the CGAL
  kernel thereby fully maintaining backwards compatibility; nothing
  changes on the user level.

* In the CGALi part, all types are referred to as K::Type rather than
  Type<K>.

* In the CGALi part, all functions have a kernel object as last
  argument, not only to ease the matching (no explicit template
  argument needed), but also to be able to handle kernels with state.

2.6 (4 April 2003)
- reflected the changes of 2.5.7 in web directory

2.5.7 (25 February 2003)
- Generalize wmult() to work with Filtered_kernel<> and more.

2.5.5 (30 October 2002)
- fixed one thing in .fw file that was only altered in generated file

2.5.4 (29 October 2002)
- rename leftturn and co to left_turn and co.
- make it work with GMP++.

2.5.3 (17 January 2002)
+ Put some member functions inside the class definition to avoid bugs of
  the MSVC 6 compiler.

2.5.2 (11 December 2001)
+ Made point-line distance computation significantly faster (10 to 30 times)

2.5 (7 December 2001)
+ Added three classes that compute distance from a Point_2 to a fixed object.
  The object is either a line, a ray or a segment.

2.4.2 (19 February 2001)
+ Bug fix in wdot function in squared_distance_utils.h.

2.4 (14 February 2001)
+ Added flags for SIMPLE kernels.
+ Rewrote wdot in terms of wmult.

2.3.6 (11 October 2000)
+ changed name of identifier or (a reserved name).

----
2.3.5 (19 June 2000)
+ Qualified calls to 'abs' and 'sign' by CGAL_NTS

-----
* 2.3.4 *
+ fix to cgal_test
+ removed include file guards

-----
* 2.3.3 *
+ Small fix to cgal_test

-----
* 2.3.2 *
+Altered implementation of wdot and wcross to circumvent a bug in the
 MSVC compiler.

-----
* 2.3.1 *
+Added typename in places (bug introduced by replacement of R_FT_return macros)

-----
* 2.3 *
+Replaced R_FT_return and R_FT_return macros by R::RT and R::FT.
+Reordered the code so that no forward declarations are necessary any more,
 in order to circumvent a bug in the MSVC compiler.

-----
* 2.2 *
+Fixed two forward declarations.

-----
* 2.1.3 *
+Adapted cgal_test and makefile in test directory to new install_cgal script.

-----
* 2.1.2 *
+Added std prefix to test programs.
+Minor changes in cgal_test script.
