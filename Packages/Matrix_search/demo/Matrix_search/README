---------------------------

Interactive demo programs of some optimisation algorithms in CGAL.
Input (mouse clicks) and output are visualized in a LEDA window.

The provided makefile is prepared to link with LEDA.


all_furthest_neighbors_2_demo: 

generates a random convex polygon (with 30 vertices) and computes for
all vertices the furthest neighbor. If the left mouse button is
clicked near a vertex, the corresponding furthest neighbor is marked
with a little circle. Quit by clicking the middle or right mouse
button.


extremal_polygon_2_demo:

compute the largest are or perimeter k-gon that can be inscribed into
a convex polygon. vertices can be added with the left, moved with the
middle and deleted with the right mouse button. There is a button to
generate random convex polygons and a slider to change k and n (the
number of vertices to generate).
