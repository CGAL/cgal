                   -----------------------------------
                   Life is not perfect, unfortunately.
                   -----------------------------------

Here is a list of problems I found wrt correct handling of IEEE 754 doubles,
with the rounding modes used in this package.

1/ On Intel platforms (Linux and Windows, any compiler):
--------------------------------------------------------

  The processor has wider registers than it should, namely wider exponent, as
  well as wider mantissa.
  This is bad because there is a rounding (truncation) that is done when a
  variable is flushed back to memory from a register, and you cannot control
  _when_ this is performed, so it could be done with a wrong rounding mode,
  or after the value changed its sign (which reverses rounding), so it's not
  correctly rounded !

  Solution:
  - you can force the processor to have exactly 53 bits of mantissa,
    like IEEE doubles.  This is done automatically by the rounding mode
    changing macros.  This way, everything is ok as long as you don't play
    with underflow/overflow (exponent gets out of range).
    However, there's no way to set the exponent width, and it's always buggy !
    The solution is to force manually the value back to memory, when needed,
    that is after each potentially inexact operation that needs to be rounded
    (+, -, *, /, sqrt).
    This is the approach implemented, but it slows the code, and is not
    always useful.
  - Another approach would be to use "long doubles".  But I fear it's slower
    and takes more memory.  Moreover, I think you have to use assembly to use
    them with Visual C++.

2/ Constant propagation:
------------------------

  Compilers usually propagate the value at compile time, for the variables for
  which he knows the values.  The is rarely the case for predicates, as well
  as any real stuff.  But it can happen, just like in the test-suite.

  Solution:
  - stopping propagation by disabling optimization (=> slow).
  - put the constant in a global variable.
  - using a macro with "volatile" in the Interval_nt constructor, which stops
    any propagation at the entry.  The drawback is that it also stops many
    other optimizations.  We now use this macro only just before it is needed.

3/ std::sqrt() on Windows (GCC/CygWin and VC++):
------------------------------------------------

  When you don't optimize, std::sqrt() calls a library routine instead of the
  assembly instruction "fsqrt".
  This is plain stupid, and moreover this library routine appears to be buggy !
  The fix would be to provide our own cgal_sqrt_ms_workaround() in extern C
  precompiled module.
  GCC/CygWin now uses inline assembly to simplify the installation.
  Hopefully VC++ will follow the same path.
  
4/ is_valid() bug with VC++:
----------------------------

  This nice compiler returns "true" for the comparison "NaN == NaN".
  This is plain buggy, and breaks is_valid().

  It also breaks all other places where we could rely on this property,
  which could be a lot of places in operator*() or operator/() for example.
  This code review (NaN propagation) has not been done yet, so it's not
  more a problem on VC++ as on the other platforms.

  These kind of problem could be handled by the wrapper class Double_IEEE,
  but with a speed penalty.

5/ Problems with IRIX / MipsPro:
--------------------------------

  The C functions to acces rounding modes provided by the system appear
  not to work correctly !  So we had to provide C functions compiled by GCC,
  and link them into libCGAL.

  Another "problem" is that when you don't parenthesize an expression with
  doubles, MipsPro believes it can optimize more than it should (reordering
  computations).  So I had to add additionnal parenthesis...
  For example, MipsPro compiles "a*-b" to "-(a*b)" instead of "a*(-b)".
  
  Solution: adding parenthesis.

  Also, it seems it optimizes "d<=d" to true, even if d is NaN...

6/ ISO C99:
-----------

  The new (May'00) C standard specifies compiler and library requirements
  to implement portable interval arithmetic !!!
  Problem: it's not fully implemented anywhere that I know of, yet...
