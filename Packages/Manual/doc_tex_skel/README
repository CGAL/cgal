Organization of a doc_tex directory
-------------------------------------

This directory contains
   basic/            -- subdirectory for the Basic Library reference and user
                        manuals
   cgal-manual.bib   -- BibTex entries for the manual that are not part of
                        (the local copy of) geom.bib
   docdirs           -- list of subdirectories containing parts of the manual
   Fig/              -- contains the gif files for the CGAL logo
   general/          -- subdirectory for the General Introduction to CGAL
   html_wrapper      -- generic wrapper file for the conversion to HTML of
                        each part of the manual located in its own 
                        subsubdirectory with a separate main.tex file.
   installation/     -- subdirectory for the Installation Guide
   kernel/           -- subdirectory for the Kernel Reference Manual
   kernel_d/         -- subdirectory for the D-dim. Kernel Reference Manual
   makefile          -- for running the manual test suite and creating a
                       "final" version of the manual
   support/          -- subdirecotry for the Support Library Reference Manual
   use_of_stl/       -- subdirectory for the Use Of STL and STL Extensions in 
                        CGAL Manual

Each subdirectory corresponding to a part of the manual contains
   -- a wrapper.tex file, which is the main tex file for that part of the
      manual
   -- an html directory (created by the to_html script)
   -- an html_test directory (created by the test_html script)

   If this part of the manual has separate packages (e.g., basic library and
   support library) the directory contains:
      -- a 'docdirs' file that lists the subdirectories corresponding to the
         various parts of the manual
      -- subsubdirectories for the various parts as well as one called Title
         (which contains the tex file and a file title.html) and one called
         Bibliography
      -- in each subsubdirectory a file called main.tex that is the main LaTeX
         file for this piece of the manual

   If this part of the manual does not have separate package, it should
      -- NOT contain a file called 'docdirs'
      -- contain the .tex files for the manual
