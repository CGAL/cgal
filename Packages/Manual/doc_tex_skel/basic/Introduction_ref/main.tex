\section{Inclusion Order of Header files}
Not all compilers fully support standard header names. \cgal\ provides 
workarounds for these problems in \ccc{CGAL/basic.h}. Consequently, as a 
golden rule, you should always include \ccc{CGAL/basic.h} first in your 
programs (or \ccc{CGAL/Cartesian.h}, or \ccc{CGAL/Homogeneous.h}, since they 
include \ccc{CGAL/basic.h} first).
