\ccPkgSummary{All classes in the \cgal\ kernel provide input and output operators for
IO streams.  
The basic task of such an operator is to produce a
representation of an object that can be written as a sequence of
characters on devices as a console, a file, or a pipe. In \cgal\
we distinguish between  a raw ascii, a raw binary and a
pretty printing format.}
