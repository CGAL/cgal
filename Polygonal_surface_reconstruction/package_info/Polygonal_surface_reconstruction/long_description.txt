This package provides a method for piecewise planar object reconstruction from point clouds.
The method takes as input an unordered point set (and optionally planar segments) of a piecewise planar
object and outputs a lightweight and watertight surface mesh interpolating the input point set. The
method can handle arbitrary piecewise planar objects and is capable of recovering sharp features and is
robust to noise and outliers.
