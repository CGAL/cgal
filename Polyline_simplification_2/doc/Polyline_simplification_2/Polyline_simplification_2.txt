This package allows to simplify polylines with the guarantee that the
topology of the polylines does not change. This can be done for a
single polyline as well as for a set of polyline constraints in a
constrained triangulation. The simplification can be controlled with
cost and stop functions.

\section Section_PolylineSimplification_Introduction Introduction

<em>Polyline simplification</em> is the process of reducing the
number of vertices used in a set of polylines while keeping the
overall shape as much as possible.


<em>Topology preserving polyline simplification</em> means that neither
intersections are introduced, nor the nesting level of a polygon
changes: islands do not intersect a simplified coastline, and islands
stay in the water.

The method implemented in this package is based on
\cite cgal:dds-scs-09.  It can simplify any set of polylines, open or
closed, and possibly intersecting themselves or each other. The method
consists of iteratively replacing edges `(p,q)` and `(q,r)`
with edge `(p,r)` by removing the vertex `q` from one
polyline. The topology of the polyline set is preserved during the
simplification as the algorithm guarantees that no new intersections
occur as a result of removing a vertex.

Vertices are removed according to a priority given for the vertex by a
user-supplied *cost* function which calculates the *simplification
error*. The cost function is a measure of the deviation between the
original polyline and the current polyline without the vertex.

The algorithm terminates when a user-supplied *stop predicate* returns
true, for instance, upon reaching a desired number of vertices or
reaching a maximum simplification error.

The polyline simplification algorithm operates on a triangulation
class from Chapter \ref Chapter_2D_Triangulations, namely
`Constrained_triangulation_plus_2`.  This data structure allows to
remove vertices of a polyline constraint, while keeping the points of
the removed vertices of the polyline constraint. The fact that it is a
triangulation allows to perform the topology check for vertices
`p,q,r` efficiently, as this can be decided based on the set of
vertices adjacent to `q` in the triangulation.

\section Section_PolylineSimplification_Cost_Functions Cost Functions

The specific way in which the removal cost is calculated is called the *cost*
function. The user can choose different strategies by choosing
a cost function object.

This package provides the three cost functions formulated in 
\cite cgal:dds-scs-09.  As the cost function is a template argument of the
simplification function, users can write and use their own.  The
provided cost functions are all based on measuring the Euclidean
distance between a subsequence of the original polyline and the
corresponding subsequence of the simplified polyline with the vertex
whose cost is calculated being removed.

Let vertices `p`, `q`, and `r` be three consecutive vertices of a
polyline constraint. If the vertex `q` is removed, the edges `(p,q)`
and `(q,r)` would be replaced by the edge `(p,r)`.


\subsection Subsection_PolylineSimplification_Maximum_Squared_Distance Maximum Squared Distance


The maximum squared distance is the maximum of the squared Euclidean
distances between each point on the original polyline between `p` and
`r` and the line segment `(p,r)`. Let \f$s_0,...,s_n\f$ be the points
strictly between `p` and `r` on the original polyline.  The cost of
removing vertex `q` is: \f$ v_1 = \max \{ \mathrm{squared\_distance}((p,r), s_i) |
i=0,..,n\} \f$

\subsection Subsection_PolylineSimplification_Scaled_Maximum_Squared_Distance Scaled Maximum Squared Distance

When it is important to preserve the separation of adjacent polylines,
a variation of the maximum squared distance cost can be used. Here the
maximum is divided by the minimum squared Euclidean distance between
the candidate vertex `q` and all its adjacent vertices (except `p` and
`r`). Those are all vertices in adjacent polylines, or adjacent
regions of the same polyline.

Let \f$t_0,...,t_m\f$ be the points of the vertices adjacent to vertex
`q`, different from `p` and `r` and let \f$ v_2 = \min \{ \mathrm{squared\_distance}((p,r),
t_i) | i=0,..,n\}\f$. The cost of removing vertex `q` is
\f$v_1/v_2\f$, and it is +infinity when the set of points \f${t_1..t_m}\f$ 
is empty (possible if the point `q` is on the convex hull).
See also \cgalFigureRef{figure_scaledAndHybrid}.

This distance measure gives lower priority to vertices with close
neighboring polylines.

\subsection Subsection_PolylineSimplification_Hybrid_Maximum_Squared_Distance Hybrid Maximum Squared Distance

The scaled maximum works well in areas with close neighboring
polylines, while the absolute maximum works *better* in areas where
the polylines are far apart. In certain applications such as
cartographic contours, there are both dense and spare areas, so a good
strategy is to use a scaled or an absolute maximum depending on the
case.

The hybrid distance measure uses a parameter \f$R\f$ to indicate which
measure to use: if \f$v_2\f$ , i.e., the minimum distance to adjacent
vertices, is below\f$R\f$, the scaled maximum is used, otherwise the
absolute maximum is used.

The cost of removing vertex `q` is \f$v_1/v_2\f$, if \f$v_2 <R\f$, and
\f$v_1/R\f$, otherwise.

As Dyken\&al. explain, the choice of a good value for \f$R\f$ is problem
specific.  It may depend on the pen size or the pixel size when
drawing, or on the grid size when the polyline points are on a grid.

\section Section_PolylineSimplification_Examples Examples

The first example shows how to simplify a `Polygon_2`.  We then show
how to simplify simultaneously several polylines, and show how to mark
polyline vertices so that they do not get removed. The last example
shows how to keep, access, and really remove points of polyline
vertices that got removed by the simplification.

\subsection Subsection_PolylineSimplification_Simplifying Simplifying a Polygon

The first example shows how to simplify a single polyline by halving
the number of vertices.

\cgalExample{Polyline_simplification_2/simplify_polygon.cpp}


\subsection Subsection_PolylineSimplification_Simplifying_Several Simplifying Several Polylines

In the second example we insert several polygons in a
`Constrained_triangulation_plus_2`.    As a vertex 
type we have to use `CGAL::Polyline_simplification_2::Vertex_base_2`
as vertices may be marked as non-removable. The simplification
algorithm marks the first and last vertex of polyline constraints
as well as intersections.  Finally, we iterate
over all vertices of all polyline constraints.

\cgalExample{Polyline_simplification_2/simplify.cpp}


\subsection Subsection_PolylineSimplification_Keeping Keeping Points While Removing Vertices

In this example we show the version of
`Polyline_simplification_2::simplify()` that simplifies a single
polyline constraint, and keeps the points while removing vertices.

During the simplification the cost functions need the original
sequence of points.  As explained in the introduction the
`Constrained_triangulation_plus_2` allows to remove vertices from
a polyline constraint, and hence from the triangulation, while keeping
the points in the polyline constraint. This explains why there is a
\link Constrained_triangulation_plus_2::Vertices_in_constraint_iterator `Vertices_in_constraint_iterator`\endlink and a \link Constrained_triangulation_plus_2::Points_in_constraint_iterator `Point_in_constraint_iterator`\endlink.

With the last argument of `Polyline_simplification_2::simplify()` set
to `true`, we can keep the points even when the simplification
function has returned.  We might want to keep them, because we want to
call `Polyline_simplification_2::simplify()` once again for the same
polyline constraint, while measuring the simplification error against
the original polyline.

The print function traverses each polyline constraint twice. First we
print the points on the simplified polyline, and then we print the
points of the original polyline.

At the end we remove the points that were kept from the constraints.

\section Section_PolylineSimplification_History Design and Implementation History

Dyken et al \cite cgal:dds-scs-09 combine a classical polyline
simplification algorithm with the triangulation of polylines in order
to check if an elementary simplification step can be performed. In our
implementation we simplified this test even further.

Fernando Cacciola made a first prototype implementation for
GeometryFactory.
