\section secQPdef Which Programs can be Solved?

This package lets you solve <I>convex quadratic programs</I> of the
general form
\f{eqnarray*}{
\mbox{(QP)}& \mbox{minimize}
& \qpx^{T}D\qpx+\qpc^{T}\qpx+c_0 \\
&\mbox{subject to} & A\qpx\qprel \qpb, \\
& & \qpl \leq \qpx \leq \qpu
\f}
in \f$ n\f$ real variables \f$ \qpx=(x_0,\ldots,x_{n-1})\f$.

Here,
<UL>
<LI>\f$ A\f$ is an \f$ m\times n\f$ matrix (the constraint matrix),
<LI>\f$ \qpb\f$ is an \f$ m\f$-dimensional vector (the right-hand side),
<LI>\f$ \qprel\f$ is an \f$ m\f$-dimensional vector of relations
from \f$ \{\leq, =, \geq\}\f$,

<LI>\f$ \qpl\f$ is an \f$ n\f$-dimensional vector of lower
bounds for \f$ \qpx\f$, where \f$ l_j\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}\f$ for all \f$ j\f$
<LI>\f$ \qpu\f$ is an \f$ n\f$-dimensional vector of upper bounds for
\f$ \qpx\f$, where \f$ u_j\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}\f$ for all \f$ j\f$

<LI>\f$ D\f$ is a symmetric positive-semidefinite \f$ n\times n\f$ matrix (the
quadratic objective function),

<LI>\f$ \qpc\f$ is an \f$ n\f$-dimensional vector (the linear objective
function), and
<LI>\f$ c_0\f$ is a constant.

</UL>

If \f$ D=0\f$, the program (QP) is actually a <I>linear program</I>.
Section \ref secQProbustness on robustness briefly discusses
the case of \f$ D\f$ not being positive-semidefinite and therefore not
defining a convex program.

<I>Solving</I> the program means to find an \f$ n\f$-vector \f$ \qpx^*\f$
such that \f$ A\qpx^*\qprel \qpb,
\qpl\leq \qpx^*\leq \qpu\f$ (a <I>feasible solution</I>),
and with the smallest objective function value
\f$ {\qpx^*}^TD\qpx^*+\qpc^T\qpx^*+c_0\f$
among all feasible solutions.

There might be no feasible solution at all, in which
case the quadratic program is <I>infeasible</I>, or there might be
feasible solutions of arbitrarily small objective function value, in
which case the program is <I>unbounded</I>.

\section QP_solverDesign Design, Efficiency, and Robustness

The design of the package is quite simple. The linear
or quadratic program to be solved is supplied in form of an object
of a class that is a model of the concept `QuadraticProgram`
(or some specialized other concepts, e.g. for linear programs). \cgal provides a number of easy-to-use and flexible models, see Section
\ref secQPfirst below. The input data may be of any given number
type, such as `double`, `int`, or any exact type.

Then the program is solved using the function
`solve_quadratic_program()` (or some specialized other functions,
e.g. for linear programs). For this, you also have to provide a
suitable <I>exact</I> number type `ET` used in the solution
process. In case of input type `double`, solution methods that use
floating-point-filtering are chosen by default for certain programs
(in some cases, this is not appropriate, and the default should be
changed; see Section \ref secQPcustomization for details).

The output of this is an object of `Quadratic_program_solution<ET>`
which you can in turn query for various things: what is the status of
the program (optimally solved, infeasible, or unbounded?), what are
the values of the optimal solution \f$ \qpx^*\f$, what is the associated
objective function value, etc.

You can in particular get <I>certificates</I> for the solution. In short,
these are proofs that the output is correct. Thus, if you don't believe
in the solution (whether it says "optimally solved", "infeasible",
or "unbounded"), you can verify it yourself by using the certificates.
Section \ref secQPcertificates says more about this.

\subsection QP_solverEfficiency Efficiency

The concept `QuadraticProgram` (as well as the
other specialized ones) require a <I>dense interface</I>
of the program, in terms of <I>random-access iterators</I> over
the matrices and vectors of (QP). Zero entries therefore play no
special role and are treated like all other entries by the
interface.

This has mainly historical
reasons: the original motivation behind this package was
low-dimensional geometric optimization where
a dense representation is appropriate and efficient. In fact,
the \cgal packages `Min_annulus_d<Traits>` and
`Polytope_distance_d<Traits>` internally use the linear
and quadratic programming solver.

As a user, however, you don't necessarily have to provide a dense
<I>representation</I> of your program. You do not pass vectors or
matrices to the solution functions, but rather specify the vectors
and matrices through iterators. The iterator abstraction
easily allows to build models that convert a sparse representation
into a dense interface. The predefined models `Quadratic_program<NT>`
and `Quadratic_program_from_mps<NT>` do exactly this; in using them,
you can forget about the dense interface.

Nevertheless, if you care about efficiency, you cannot completely
ignore the issue. If
you think about a quadratic program in \f$ n\f$ variables and \f$ m\f$
constraints, its dense interface has \f$ \Theta(n^2 + mn)\f$ entries,
even if actually very few of them are nonzero. This has consequences
for the complexity of the internal computations. In fact, a single
iteration of the solution process has complexity at least
\f$ \Omega(mn)\f$, since usually, all entries of the matrix \f$ A\f$ are accessed.
This implies that problems where \f$ \min(n,m)\f$ is large cannot be solved
efficiently, even if the number of nonzero entries in the problem
description is very small.

We can actually be quite precise about performance, in terms of the
following parameters.

<DL>
<DT>\f$n\f$</DT><DD>the number of variables (or columns of \f$A\f$),</DD>
<DT>\f$m\f$</DT><DD>the number of constraints (or rows of \f$A\f$)</DD>
<DT>\f$e\f$</DT><DD>the number of equality constraints,</DD>
<DT>\f$r\f$</DT><DD>the rank of the quadratic objective function matrix \f$D\f$.</DD>
</DL>

The time required to solve the problems is in most cases linear in
\f$ \max(n,m)\f$, but with a factor heavily depending on \f$ \min(n,e)+r\f$.
Therefore, the solver will be efficient only if \f$ \min(n,e)+r\f$ is
small.

Here are the scenarios in which this applies:
<UL>
<LI>Quadratic programs with a small number of variables, but
possibly a large number of inequality constraints,
<LI>Linear programs with a small number of equality constraints but
possibly a large number of variables,
<LI>Quadratic programs with a small number of equality constraints and
\f$ D\f$ of small rank, but possibly with a large number of variables.
</UL>

How small is small? If \f$ \min(n,e)+r\f$ is up to \f$ 10\f$, the solver will
probably be very fast, even if \f$ \max(n,m)\f$ goes into the millions.
If \f$ \min(n,m)+r\f$ is up to a few hundreds, you may still get a solution
within reasonable time, depending on the problem characteristics.

If you have a problem where both \f$ n\f$ and \f$ e\f$ are well above
\f$ 1,000\f$, say, then chances are high that \cgal cannot solve it
within reasonable time.

\subsection secQProbustness Robustness

Given that you use an <I>exact number type</I> in the function
`solve_quadratic_program` (or in the other, specialized
solution functions), the solver
will give you <I>exact rational output</I>, for <I>every</I>
convex quadratic program. It may fail to compute a solution only if
<OL>
<LI>The quadratic program is too large (see the previous subsection
on efficiency).
<LI>The quadratic objective function matrix \f$ D\f$ is not
positive-semidefinite (see the discussion below).
<LI>The floating-point filter used by default for certain programs
and input type `double` fails due to a <I>double</I> exponent
overflow. This happens in rare cases only, and it does not pay off
to sacrifice the efficiency of the filtered approach in order to
cope with these rare cases. There are means, however, to avoid such
problems by switching to a slower non-filtered variant, see Section
\ref secQPcustomizationfiltering.
<LI>The solver internally cycles. This also happens in rare
cases only. However, if
you have a hunch that the solver cycles on your problem,
there are means to switch to a slower variant that is guaranteed
not to cycle, see Section \ref secQPcustomizationcycling.
</OL>

The second item merits special attention. First, you may ask why the
solver does not check that \f$ D\f$ is positive semidefinite. But recall
that \f$ D\f$ is given by a dense interface, and it would therefore cost
\f$ \Omega(n^2)\f$ time already to access all entries of the matrix \f$ D\f$.
The solver itself gets away with accessing much less entries of
\f$ D\f$ in the relevant case where \f$ r\f$, the rank of \f$ D\f$, is small.

Nevertheless, the solver contains some runtime checks
that may detect that the matrix \f$ D\f$ is not positive-semidefinite. But
you may as well get an "optimal solution" in this case, even with
valid certificates. The validity of these certificates, however,
depends on \f$ D\f$ being positive-semidefinite; if this is not the case, the
certificates only prove that the solver has found a "critical point" of
your (nonconvex) program, but there are no guarantees whatsoever that
this is a global optimum, or even a local optimum.

\section secQPfirst How to Enter and Solve a Program

In this section, we describe how you can supply and solve your problem,
using the \cgal program models and solution functions.
There are two essentially different ways to proceed,
and we will discuss them in turn. In short,
<UL>
<LI>you can let the model take care of your program data; you start
from an empty program and then simply insert the non-zero entries, or
read them from a file (more generally, any input stream) in
`MPSFormat`. You can also change program entries at any time.
This is usually the most convenient way if you don't want to care
about representation issues;
<LI>you can maintain the data yourself and only supply suitable
random-access iterators over the matrices and vectors. This is
advantageous if you already have the data (explicitly, or implicitly
encoded, for example through iterators) and want to avoid copying
of data. Typically, this happens if you write generic iterator-based
code.
</UL>

Our running example is the following quadratic program in two variables:
\f[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
\mbox{minimize} & x^2 + 4(y-4)^2 &(=& x^2 + 4y^2 - 32y + 64) \\
\mbox{subject to} & x + y &\leq& 7 \\
& -x + 2y &\leq& 4 \\
& x &\geq& 0 \\
& y &\geq& 0 \\
& y &\leq& 4
\end{array}
\f]

\cgalFigureRef{figQPfirst_qp} shows a picture. It
depicts the five inequalities of the program, along with the
<I>feasible region</I> (green), the set of points that satisfy all the
five constraints. The dashed elliptic curves represent <I>contour lines</I>
of the objective function, i.e., along each dashed curve, the objective
function value is constant.

The global minimum of the objective function is attained at
the point \f$ (0,4)\f$, and the minimum within the feasible region appears
at the point \f$ (2,3)\f$ marked with a black dot. The value of the objective
function at this optimal solution is \f$ 2^2 + 4(3-4)^2 = 8\f$.

\subsection QP_solverConstructingaProgramfromData Constructing a Program from Data

Here is how this quadratic program can be solved in \cgal
according to the first way (letting the model take care of
the data). We use `int` as the input type, and
`MP_Float` or `Gmpz` (which is faster and preferable if
<TT>GMP</TT> is installed) as the exact type for the
internal computations. In larger examples, it pays off to use
`double` as input type in order to profit from the
automatic floating-point filtering that takes place then.

For examples
how to work with the input type `double`, we refer to
Sections \ref secQPiterators and \ref secQPcustomization.

<B>Note:</B> For the quadratic objective function, the entries
of the matrix \f$ 2D\f$ have to be provided, rather than \f$ D\f$. Although
this is common to almost all quadratic programming solvers, it
can easily be overlooked by a novice.

\cgalExample{QP_solver/first_qp.cpp}

Asuming that <TT>GMP</TT> is installed, the
output of the of the above program is:
\verbatim
status: OPTIMAL
objective value: 8/1
variable values:
0: 2/1
1: 3/1
\endverbatim
If <TT>GMP</TT> is not installed, the values are of course the same,
but numerator and denominator might have a common divisor that is not
factored out.

\subsection QP_solverConstructingaProgramfromaStream Constructing a Program from a Stream

Here, the program data must be available in `MPSFormat` (the
`MPSFormat` page shows how our running example looks like in
this format, and it briefly explains the format). Assuming that
your working directory contains the file <TT>first_qp.mps</TT>,
the following program will read and solve it, with the same output
as before.

\cgalExample{QP_solver/first_qp_from_mps.cpp}

\subsection QP_solverConstructingaProgramfromIterators Constructing a Program from Iterators

The following program again solves our running example from above,
with the same output, but this time with iterators over data stored
in suitable containers. You can see that we also store zero
entries here (in \f$ D\f$). For this toy problem, the previous two
approaches (program from data/stream) are clearly preferable,
but Section \ref secQPiterators shows an
example where it makes sense to use the iterator-based approach.

\cgalExample{QP_solver/first_qp_from_iterators.cpp}

<B>Note 1:</B> The example shows an interesting feature of this approach:
not all data need to come from containers. Here, the iterator over the
vector of relations can be provided through the class
`Const_oneset_iterator<T>`, since all entries of this vector
are equal to `SMALLER`. The same could have been done with
the vector `fl` for the finiteness of the lower bounds.

<B>Note 2:</B> The program type looks a bit scary, with its total of
9 template arguments, one for each iterator type. In Section
\ref secQPmakers we show how the explicit construction of
this type can be circumvented.

\section secQPlp Solving Linear and Nonnegative Programs

Let us reconsider the general form of (QP) from Section \ref secQPdef
above. If \f$ D=0\f$, the quadratic program is in fact a <I>linear program</I>,
and in the case that the bound vectors \f$ l\f$ is the zero vector and all
entries of \f$ u\f$ are \f$ \infty\f$, the program is said to be <I>nonnegative</I>.
The package offers dedicated models and solution methods for these special
cases.

From an interface perspective, this is just syntactic sugar: in the
model `Quadratic_program<NT>`, we can easily set the default bounds
so that a nonnegative program results, and a linear program is
obtained by simply not inserting any \f$ D\f$-entries. Even in the
iterator-based approach (see
\ref QP_solver/first_qp_from_iterators.cpp), linear
and nonnegative programs can easily be defined through suitable
`Const_oneset_iterator<T>`-style iterators.

The main reason for having dedicated solution methods for linear and
nonnegative programs is efficiency: if the solver knows that the program
is linear, it can save some computations compared to the general solver
that unknowingly has to fiddle around with a zero \f$ D\f$-matrix. As in
Section \ref secQProbustness above, we can argue that checking in
advance whether \f$ D=0\f$ is not an option in general, since this may require
\f$ \Omega(n^2)\f$ time on the dense interface.

Similarly, if the solver knows that the program is nonnegative, it
will be more efficient than under the general bounds
\f$ \qpl\leq \qpx \leq \qpu\f$.
You can argue that nonnegativity <I>is</I> something that could easily
be checked in time \f$ O(n)\f$ beforehand, but then again nonnegative
programs are so frequent that the syntactic sugar aspect becomes
somewhat important. After all, we can save four iterators in
specifying a nonnegative linear program in terms of the concept
`NonnegativeLinearProgram` rather than
`LinearProgram`.

Often, there are no bounds at all for the variables, i.e., all entries
of \f$ \qpl\f$ are \f$ -\infty\f$, and all entries of \f$ \qpu\f$
are \f$ \infty\f$ (this is
called a <I>free</I> program). There is no dedicated solution method
for this case (a free quadratic or linear program is treated like a
general quadratic or linear program), but all predefined models make
it easy to specify all sorts of default bounds, covering the free
case.

\subsection QP_solverTheLinearProgrammingSolver The Linear Programming Solver

Let's go back to our first quadratic program from above and change it
into a linear program by simply removing the quadratic part of the
objective function:

\f[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
\mbox{minimize} & - 32y + 64 \\
\mbox{subject to} & x + y &\leq& 7 \\
& -x + 2y &\leq& 4 \\
& x &\geq& 0 \\
& y &\geq& 0 \\
& y &\leq& 4
\end{array}
\f]

\cgalFigureRef{figQPfirst_lp} shows how this looks like. We will not
visualize a linear objective function with contour lines but with
arrows instead. The arrow represents the (direction) of the vector \f$ -c\f$,
and we are looking for a feasible solution that is "extreme" in the direction
of the arrow. In our small example, this is the unique point "on" the
two constraints \f$ x_1+x_2\leq 7\f$ and \f$ -x_1+x_2\leq 4\f$, the point
\f$ (10/3,11/3)\f$ marked with a black dot. The optimal objective function
value is \f$ -32(11/3)+64=-160/3\f$.

\cgalFigureBegin{figQPfirst_lp,first_lp.png}
A linear program in two variables
\cgalFigureEnd

Here is \cgal code for solving it, using the dedicated LP solver, and
according to the three ways for constructing a program that we have
already discussed in Section \ref secQPfirst.

\ref QP_solver/first_lp.cpp

\ref QP_solver/first_lp_from_mps.cpp

\ref QP_solver/first_lp_from_iterators.cpp

In all cases, the output is
\verbatim
status: OPTIMAL
objective value: -160/3
variable values:
0: 10/3
1: 11/3
\endverbatim

\subsection QP_solverTheNonnegativeQuadraticProgramming The Nonnegative Quadratic Programming Solver

If we go back to our first quadratic program and
remove the constraint \f$ y\leq 4\f$, we arrive at a nonnegative quadratic
program:

\f[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
\mbox{minimize} & x^2 + 4(y-4)^2 &(=& x^2 + 4y^2 - 32y + 64) \\
\mbox{subject to} & x + y &\leq& 7 \\
& -x + 2y &\leq& 4 \\
& x,y &\geq& 0
\end{array}
\f]

\cgalFigureRef{figQPfirst_nonnegative_qp} contains
the illustration; since the constraint \f$ y\leq 4\f$ was
redundant, the feasible region and the optimal solution do
not change.

\cgalFigureBegin{figQPfirst_nonnegative_qp,first_nonnegative_qp.png}
A nonnegative quadratic program in two variables
\cgalFigureEnd

The following programs (using the dedicated solver for nonnegative
quadratic programs) will therefore again output
\verbatim
status: OPTIMAL
objective value: 8/1
variable values:
0: 2/1
1: 3/1
\endverbatim

\ref QP_solver/first_nonnegative_qp.cpp

\ref QP_solver/first_nonnegative_qp_from_mps.cpp

\ref QP_solver/first_nonnegative_qp_from_iterators.cpp

\subsection QP_solverTheNonnegativeLinearProgramming The Nonnegative Linear Programming Solver

Finally, a dedicated model and function is available for nonnnegative linear
programs as well. Let's take our linear program from above and remove
the constraint \f$ y\leq 4\f$ to obtain a nonnegative linear program. At
the same time we remove the constant objective function term to get
a "minimal" input and a "shortest" program; the optimal value is
\f$ -32(11/3)=-352/3\f$.

\f[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
\mbox{minimize} & - 32y \\
\mbox{subject to} & x + y &\leq& 7 \\
& -x + 2y &\leq& 4 \\
& x,y &\geq& 0 \\
\end{array}
\f]

This can be solved by any of the following three programs

\ref QP_solver/first_nonnegative_lp.cpp

\ref QP_solver/first_nonnegative_lp_from_mps.cpp

\ref QP_solver/first_nonnegative_lp_from_iterators.cpp

The output will always be
\verbatim
status: OPTIMAL
objective value: -352/3
variable values:
0: 10/3
1: 11/3
\endverbatim

\section secQPiterators Working from Iterators

Here we present a somewhat more advanced example that emphasizes the
usefulness of solving linear and quadratic programs from iterators.
Let's look at a situation in which a linear program is given implicitly,
and access to it is gained through properly constructed iterators.

The problem we are going to solve is the following: given points
\f$ p_1,\ldots p_{n}\f$ in \f$ d\f$-dimensional space and another point \f$ p\f$: is
\f$ p\f$ in the convex hull of \f$ \{p_1,\ldots,p_{n}\}\f$? In formulas, this is
the case if and only if there are real coefficients
\f$ \lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n\f$ such that \f$ p\f$ is a convex combination of
\f$ p_1,\ldots,p_n\f$:
\f$
p = \ccSum{j=1}{n}{~\lambda_j~p_j}, \quad \ccSum{j=1}{n}{~\lambda_j} = 1,
\quad \lambda_j \geq 0 \mbox{~for all $j$.}
\f$


The problem of testing the existence of such \f$ \lambda_j\f$ can
be expressed as a linear program. It becomes particularly easy
when we use the homogeneous representations of the points: if
\f$ q_1,\ldots,q_n,q\in\mathbb{R}^{d+1}\f$ are homogeneous coordinates for
\f$ p_1,\ldots,p_n,p\f$ with positive homogenizing coordinates
\f$ h_1,\ldots,h_n,h\f$, we have
\f[q_j = h_j \cdot (p_j \mid 1) \mbox{~for all $j$, and~} q = h \cdot
(p\mid 1).\f] Now, nonnegative \f$\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n\f$ are
suitable coefficients for a convex combination if and only if
\f[\ccSum{j=1}{n}{~ \lambda_j(p_j \mid 1)} = (p\mid 1), \f]
equivalently, if there are \f$\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_n\f$
(with \f$\mu_j = \lambda_j \cdot h/{h_j}\f$ for all \f$j\f$) such that
\f[\ccSum{j=1}{n}{~\mu_j~q_j} = q, \quad \mu_j \geq 0\mbox{~for all $j$}.\f]

The linear program now tests for the existence of nonnegative \f$ \mu_j\f$
that satisfy the latter equation. Below is the code; it defines a
function that solves the linear program, given \f$ p\f$ and
\f$ p_1,\ldots,p_n\f$ (through an iterator range). The only (mild)
trickery involved is the construction of the nested iterator
through a fixed column of the constraint matrix \f$ A\f$. We get this
from transforming the iterator through the points using a functor
that maps a point to an iterator through its homogeneous coordinates.

\cgalExample{QP_solver/solve_convex_hull_containment_lp.h}

To see this in action, let us call it with \f$ p_1=(0,0), p_2=(10,0),
p_3=(0,10)\f$ fixed (they define a triangle) and all integral points \f$ p\f$
in \f$ [0,10]^2\f$. We know that \f$ p\f$ is in the convex hull of
\f$ \{p_1,p_2,p_3\}\f$ if and only if its two coordinates sum up to \f$ 10\f$ at
most. As the exact type, we use `MP_Float` or `Gmpzf`
(which is faster and preferable if <TT>GMP</TT> is installed).

\cgalExample{QP_solver/convex_hull_containment.cpp}

\subsection secQPmakers Using Makers

You already noticed in the previous example that the actual
template arguments for
`Nonnegative_linear_program_from_iterators<A_it, B_it, R_it, C_it>`
can be quite elaborate, and this only gets worse if you plug more
iterators into each other. In general, you want to construct a
program from given expressions for the iterators, but the
types of these expressions are probably very complicated and
difficult to look up.

You can avoid the explicit construction of the type
`Nonnegative_linear_program_from_iterators<A_it, B_it, R_it, C_it>`
if you only need an expression of it, e.g. to pass it directly
as an argument to the solving function. Here is an alternative
version of `QP_solver/solve_convex_hull_containment_lp.h`
that shows how this works. In effect, you get shorter and more
readable code.

\cgalExample{QP_solver/solve_convex_hull_containment_lp2.h}

\section QP_solverImportant Important Variables and Constraints

If you have a solution \f$ \qpx^*\f$ of a linear or quadratic program,
the "important" variables are typically the ones that are not on
their bounds. In case of a nonnegative program, these are the nonzero
variables. Going back to the example of the previous Section
\ref secQPiterators, we can easily interpret their
importance: the nonzero variables correspond to points \f$ p_j\f$ that
actually contribute to the convex combination that yields \f$ p\f$.

The following example shows how we can access the important variables,
using the iterators `basic_variable_indices_begin()` and
`basic_variable_indices_end()`.

We generate a set of points that form a 4-gon in \f$ [0,4]^2\f$, and then find
the ones that contribute to the convex combinations of all 25 lattice
points in \f$ [0,4]^2\f$. If the lattice point in question is not in the 4-gon,
we simply output this fact.

\cgalExample{QP_solver/important_variables.cpp}

It turns out that exactly three of the four points contribute to any
convex combination, even through there are lattice points that lie
in the convex hull of less than three of the points. This shows that
the set of basic variables that we access in the example does not
necessarily coincide with the set of important variables as defined
above. In fact, it is only guaranteed that a non-basic variable
attains one of its bounds, but there might be basic variables that
also have this property. In linear and quadratic programming terms,
such a situation is called a <I>degeneracy</I>.

There is also the concept of an important constraint: this is
typically a constraint in the system \f$ A\qpx\qprel\qpb\f$
that is satisfied with equality at \f$ \qpx^*\f$. Program
\ref QP_solver/first_qp_basic_constraints.cpp
shows how these can be accessed, using the iterators
`basic_constraint_indices_begin()` and
`basic_constraint_indices_end()`.

Again, we have a disagreement
between "basic" and "important": it is guaranteed that all
basic constraints are satisfied with equality at \f$ \qpx^*\f$, but there
might be non-basic constraints that are satisfied with equality
as well.

\section secQPcertificates Solution Certificates

Suppose the solver tells you that the problem you have entered is
infeasible. Why should you believe this? Similarly, you can
quite easily verify that a claimed optimal solution is feasible,
but why is there no better one?

Certificates are proofs that the solver can give you in order
to convince you that what it claims is indeed true. The archetype
of such a proof is <I>Farkas Lemma</I> \cgalCite{cgal:mg-uulp-06}.

<B>Farkas Lemma:</B> <I>Either</I> the inequality system
\f[
\begin{array}{rcl}
A \qpx & \leq & \qpb \\
\qpx & \geq & 0
\end{array}
\f]
has a solution \f$ \qpx^*\f$, <I>or</I> there exists a vector \f$ \qpy\f$ such
that
\f[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\qpy &\geq& 0\\
\qpy^TA &\geq& 0\\
\qpy^T\qpb & < & 0,
\end{array}
\f]
but not both.

Thus, if someone wants to convince you that the first system in
the Farkas Lemma is infeasible, that person can simply give you
a vector \f$ \qpy\f$ that solves the second system. Since you can easily
verify yourself that the \f$ \qpy\f$ you got satisfies this second system,
you now have a certificate for the infeasibility of the first system,
assuming that you believe in Farkas Lemma.

Here we show how the solver can convince you. We first set up an infeasible
linear program with constraints of the type \f$ A\qpx\leq \qpb, \qpx\geq 0\f$; then
we solve it and ask for a certificate. Finally, we verify the certificate
by simply checking the inequalities of the second system in Farkas
Lemma.

\cgalExample{QP_solver/infeasibility_certificate.cpp}

There are similar certificates for optimality and unboundedness
that you can see in action in the programs
\ref QP_solver/optimality_certificate.cpp and
\ref QP_solver/unboundedness_certificate.cpp.
The underlying variants of Farkas Lemma are somewhat more
complicated, due to the mixed relations in \f$ \qprel\f$ and the general
bounds. The certificate section of `Quadratic_program_solution<ET>`
gives the full picture and mathematically proves the correctness
of the certificates.

\section secQPcustomization Customizing the Solver

Sometimes it is necessary to alter the default behavior of the solver.
This can be done by passing a suitably prepared object of the class
`Quadratic_program_options` to the solution functions. Most options
concern "soft" issues like verbosity, but there are two notable case
where it is of critical importance to be able to change the defaults.

\subsection secQPcustomizationfiltering Exponent Overflow in Double Using Floating-Point Filters

The filtered version of the solver that is used for some problems
by default on input
type `double` internally constructs double-approximations of exact
multiprecision values. If these exact values are extremely large, this
may lead to <I>infinite</I> `double` values and incorrect results.
In debug mode, the solver will notice this through a certificate
cross-check in the end (or even earlier). In this case, it is advisable
to explicitly switch to a non-filtered <I>pricing strategy</I>, see
\link CGAL::Quadratic_program_pricing_strategy `Quadratic_program_pricing_strategy`\endlink.

<B>Hint:</B>
If you have a program where the number of variables \f$ n\f$ and the number of
constraints \f$ m\f$ have the same order of
magnitude, the filtering will usually have
no dramatic effect on the performance, so in that case you might as well
switch to `QP_PARTIAL_DANTZIG`
to be safe from the issue described here (see
\ref QP_solver/cycling.cpp
for an example that shows how to change the pricing strategy).

\subsection secQPcustomizationcycling The Solver Internally Cycles

Consider the following program. It reads a nonnegative linear program from
the file <TT>cycling.mps</TT> (which is in the example directory as well),
and then solves it in verbose mode, using <I>Bland's rule</I>, see
\link CGAL::Quadratic_program_pricing_strategy `Quadratic_program_pricing_strategy`\endlink.
\cgalExample{QP_solver/cycling.cpp}

If you comment the line

\verbatim
options.set_pricing_strategy(CGAL::QP_BLAND); // Bland's rule
\endverbatim

you will see that the solver cycles: the verbose mode outputs the same
sequence of six iterations over and over again. By switching to
`QP_BLAND`, the solution process typically slows down a bit
(it may also speed up in some cases), but now it is guaranteed that
no cycling occurs.

In general, the verbose mode can be of use when you are not sure whether
the solver "has died", or whether it simply takes very long to solve
your problem. We refer to the class `Quadratic_program_options`
for further details.

\section secQPbenchmark Some Benchmarks for Convex Hull Containment

Here we want to show what you can expect from the solver's performance
in a specific application; we don't know whether this application is
typical in your case, and we make no claims whatsoever about the
performance in other applications.

Still, the example shows that the performance can be dramatically
affected by switching between pricing strategies, and we give some
hints on how to achieve good performance in general.

The application is the one already discussed in Section \ref secQPiterators
above: testing whether a point is in the convex hull of other points.
To be able to switch between pricing strategies, we add another
parameter of type `Quadratic_program_options` to the function
`solve_convex_hull_containment_lp` that we pass on to the solution
function:

\cgalExample{QP_solver/solve_convex_hull_containment_lp3.h}

Now let us test containment of the origin in the convex hull
of \f$ n\f$ random points in \f$ [0,1]^d\f$ (it will most likely not be contained,
and it turns out that this is the most expensive case). In the program
below, we use \f$ d=10\f$ and \f$ n=100,000\f$, and we comment on some other
combinations of \f$ n\f$ and \f$ d\f$ below (feel free to experiment with still other
values).

\cgalExample{QP_solver/convex_hull_containment_benchmarks.cpp}

If you compile with the macros <TT>NDEBUG</TT> or
<TT>CGAL_QP_NO_ASSERTIONS</TT> set (this is essential for good
performance!!), you will see runtimes that qualitatively look as
follows (on your machine, the actual runtimes will roughly be some
fixed multiples of the numbers in the table below, and they might
vary with the random choices). The default choice of the pricing
strategy in that case is `QP_PARTIAL_FILTERED_DANTZIG`.

Strategy                      | Runtime in seconds
--------------------------    | ------------------
`QP_CHOOSE_DEFAULT`           | 0.32
`QP_DANTZIG`                  | 10.7
`QP_PARTIAL_DANTZIG`          | 3.72
`QP_BLAND`                    | 3.65
`QP_FILTERED_DANTZIG`         | 0.43
`QP_PARTIAL_FILTERED_DANTZIG` | 0.32

We clearly see the effect of filtering: we gain a factor of ten,
roughly, compared to the next best non-filtered variant.

\subsection QP_solverBenchd3 d=3, n=1,000,000

The filtering effect is amplified if the points/dimension ratio becomes
larger. This is what you might see in dimension three, with one million
points.

Strategy                      | Runtime in seconds
--------------------------    | ------------------
`QP_CHOOSE_DEFAULT`           | 1.34
`QP_DANTZIG`                  | 47.6
`QP_PARTIAL_DANTZIG`          | 15.6
`QP_BLAND`                    | 16.02
`QP_FILTERED_DANTZIG`         | 1.89
`QP_PARTIAL_FILTERED_DANTZIG` | 1.34

In general, if your problem has a high variable/constraint or
constraint/variable ratio, then filtering will typically pay off.
In such cases, it might be beneficial to encode your problem using
input type `double` in order to profit from the filtering (but
see the issue discussed in Section \ref secQPcustomizationfiltering).

\subsection QP_solverBenchd100 d=100, n=100,000

Conversely, the filtering effect deteriorates if the points/dimension ratio
becomes smaller.

Strategy                      | Runtime in seconds
--------------------------    | ------------------
`QP_CHOOSE_DEFAULT`           | 3.05
`QP_DANTZIG`                  | 78.4
`QP_PARTIAL_DANTZIG`          | 45.9
`QP_BLAND`                    | 33.2
`QP_FILTERED_DANTZIG`         | 3.36
`QP_PARTIAL_FILTERED_DANTZIG` | 3.06

\subsection QP_solverBenchd500 d=500, n=1,000

If the points/dimension ratio tends to a constant, filtering is no
longer a clear winner. The reason is that in this case,
the necessary exact calculations with multiprecision numbers
dominate the overall runtime.

Strategy                      | Runtime in seconds
--------------------------    | ------------------
`QP_CHOOSE_DEFAULT`           | 2.65
`QP_DANTZIG`                  | 5.55
`QP_PARTIAL_DANTZIG`          | 5.6
`QP_BLAND`                    | 4.46
`QP_FILTERED_DANTZIG`         | 2.65
`QP_PARTIAL_FILTERED_DANTZIG` | 2.61

In general, if you have a program where the number of variables
and the number of constraints have the same order of magnitude, then
the saving gained from using the filtered approach is typically
small. In such a situation, you should consider switching to
a non-filtered variant in order to avoid the rare issue discussed
in Section \ref secQPcustomizationfiltering altogether.
