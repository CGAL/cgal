\ccPkgSummary{This package contains algorithms for minimizing linear and
convex quadratic functions over polyhedral domains, described by linear
equations and inequalities. The algorithms are exact, i.e. the solution
is computed in terms of multiprecision rational numbers.

The resulting solution is certified: along with the claims that the
problem under consideration has an optimal solution, is infeasible,
or is unbounded, the algorithms also deliver proofs for these facts.
These proofs can easily (and independently from the algorithms) be 
checked for correctness.

The solution algorithms are based on a generalization of the simplex 
method to quadratic objective functions.
