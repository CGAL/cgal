\section SectionPolygonRepair_Introduction Introduction

This package implements a polygon repair method. Starting from possibly
invalid input in the form of a polygon, polygon with holes or multipolygon
with holes, the method computes an arrangement of the input edges, labels
each face according to what it represents (exterior, polygon interior
or hole), and reconstructs the polygon(s) represented by the arrangement.
The method returns valid output stored in a multipolygon with holes.

Different arrangement and labelling heuristics are possible, but
currently only the <em>even-odd</em> rule is implemented in this package.
This rule results in areas that are alternately assigned as polygon
interiors and exterior/holes each time that an input edge is passed.
It does not distinguish between edges that are part of outer boundaries
from those of inner boundaries.  In a next version we will add the
<em>winding number</em> rule.

\section SectionPolygonRepair_Definitions Definitions

- A valid <em>polygon</em> (without holes) is a point set in \f$ \mathbb{R}^2\f$
that is bounded by a cycle of linear edges, which is known as its
<em>outer boundary</em>. This outer boundary should be <em>simple</em>,
meaning that the interiors of its edges are pairwise disjoint and all of
its vertices have a degree of two. It is thus topologically equivalent to a
disk and is represented internally as the sequence of points at the common
end points of the edges around its outer boundary.

- A valid <em>polygon with holes</em> is a point set in \f$ \mathbb{R}^2\f$
that is bounded by one outer boundary and zero or more <em>inner boundaries</em>,
where each inner boundary represents a hole in the polygon. Considered
independently, each boundary should be simple. The different boundaries of a polygon
are allowed to intersect tangentially at their common vertices (with no common
edges), forming vertices with degrees of a multiple of two the tangential points.
The interior of a polygon with holes should form a connected point set.
Note that a valid polygon can also be represented as a valid polygon with
holes (where the number of holes is zero).

- A valid <em>multipolygon with holes</em> is a point set in \f$ \mathbb{R}^2\f$
that is represented by a set of zero or more valid polygons with holes.
The interiors of the polygons with holes should be pairwise disjoint, but they
are allowed to intersect tangentially at their common vertices. Note that
a valid polygon with holes can also be represented as a valid multipolygon
with holes (with only one polygon).

with overlapping polygons, and (h) multipolygon with polygons that touch at an edge.

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Output Stricter Conditions for Output

The conditions listed above are sufficient to define valid polygons, polygons
with holes and multipolygons with holes for most applications. However, in
order to ensure unique deterministic output from the repair algorithm,
the valid multipolygons with holes returned by the package conform to more
strict criteria:

- Adjacent collinear edges touching at vertices of degree two are merged
- The sequence of vertices representing a boundary starts from its
lexicographically smallest vertex
- Outer boundaries are oriented counter-clockwise and inner boundaries are
oriented clockwise
- The inner boundaries of a polygon with holes are stored in lexicographic
order
- The polygons with holes of a multipolygon with holes are also stored in
lexicographic order

\section SectionPolygonRepair_Algorithm Algorithm

Broadly, the algorithm consists of three steps:

-# <em>Arrangement</em>: the edges in the polygon, polygon with
holes or multipolygon with holes are added as edges in the arrangement.
-# <em>Labeling of the faces</em>: the resulting faces are labeled with ids
according to what they represent (exterior, polygon interior or hole).
-# <em>Reconstruction of the multipolygon</em>: each boundary is reconstructed,
then these are assembled into individual polygons with holes and put into a
single multipolygon with holes.

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Arrangement Arrangement

For the purposes of the repair operation, the input polygon, polygon with holes
or multipolygon is merely used as a container of input line segments. These line
segments are added to the arrangement as edges. Internally, this is done using
a constrained triangulation where they are added as constraints.

With the even-odd rule, only the edges that are present an odd number of
times in the input will be edges in the final arrangement.
When these edges are only partially overlapping, only the parts that overlap
an odd number of times will be edges in the final arrangement.

This procedure is done in two steps: 1. preprocessing to eliminate identical
edges that are present an even number of times, and 2. adding edges incrementally
while applying an even-odd counting mechanism, which erases existing (parts of)
edges when new overlapping ones are added.

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Labeling Labeling

First, the polygon exterior is labeled. For this, all of the faces that can be
accessed from the exterior without passing through an edge are labeled as exterior
faces.

Then, all other faces are labeled. For the even-odd rule, the label applied
alternates between polygon interior and hole every time that an edge is passed.

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Reconstruction Reconstruction of the Multipolygon

The algorithm reconstructs the multipolygon boundary by boundary, obtaining
counter-clockwise cycles for outer boundaries and clockwise cycles for inner
boundaries. Once all boundaries have been reconstructed, the boundaries are assembled
into multipolygons using the face labels to know which polygon with holes inner/outer
boundaries belong to, and using the orientation to distinguish between the outer and
inner boundaries of each polygon with holes.

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Notes Notes on the Output

If the input is already valid, the method will return a valid output representing
the same area. However, the output might be different in order to conform to the
stricter conditions to generate deterministic output (see
\ref SubsectionPolygonRepair_Output).

Also, it is worth noting that even the repair of a single polygon without holes
but with self-intersections can result in a multipolygon with holes. This is why
the repair function will always return a multipolygon with holes. The user can
then check whether it consists of a single polygon with holes, and if a polygon
with holes has zero holes and extract these if needed.

\section SectionPolygonRepair_Examples Examples

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Repair Repairing a (Multi)polygon

It is possible to repair a polygon, polygon with holes or multipolygon with holes
using the even-odd rule by calling the `Polygon_repair::repair()` function
as shown in the following example. This function returns a repaired multipolygon with holes.

\section SectionPolygonRepair_Performance Performance

The method can repair large invalid polygons of millions of vertices in a few
seconds as long as the number of intersections between line segments is limited.
This is a realistic assumption with many invalid data sets, which only have
relatively minor issues involving a small number of their vertices/edges.
However, it is worth noting that there can be a potentially quadratic number of
intersection between edges in the worst case, leading to much worse performance
since all of these intersections need to be calculated in the overlay.

\section SectionPolygonRepair_History History

The polygon repair method as originally developed is described by Ledoux et al.
\cgalCite{ledoux2014triangulation} and implemented in the
<a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/prepair/"><em>prepair</em></a> software.
This package is a reimplementation of the method with a new approach to label
and reconstruct the multipolygons. It also incorporates improvements later
added to <em>prepair</em>, such as the application of the even-odd counting heuristics
to edges, which enables correct counting even on partially overlapping edges.

Ken Arroyo Ohori developed this package during the Google Summer of
Code 2023 mentored by SÃ©bastien Loriot and Andreas Fabri.
