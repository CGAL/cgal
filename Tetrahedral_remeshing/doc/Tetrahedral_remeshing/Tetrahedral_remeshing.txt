\section secTetRemeshing Multi-Material Tetrahedral Remeshing

This package implements an algorithm for quality tetrahedral remeshing,
introduced by N.Faraj et al in%\cgalCite{faraj2016mvr}.
This practical iterative remeshing algorithm is designed to remesh
multi-material tetrahedral meshes, by iteratively performing a sequence of simple
elementary operations such as edge collapses, edge splits, edge flips,
and vertex relocations following a Laplacian smoothing.
The algorithm results in high quality isotropic meshes, with the desired mesh density,
while preserving the input geometric polyline and surfacic features.

Specific remeshing rules have been designed to satisfy the following criteria.
First, the algorithm preserves the geometric complex topology, including
multi-material surface patches and polyline features. Polyline features
can be defined as intersections between more than two subdomains, or listed by
the user. Second, it has been made possible to remesh only a selection of cells,
instead of remeshing the whole domain, while preserving or remeshing the
interface surfaces between the preserved and the remeshed tetrahedra.

All the local atomic operations that are performed by the algorithm
preserve the input topology of the geometric complex.

The tetrahedral remeshing algorithm improves the quality of dihedral angles,
while targetting the user-defined uniform sizing field and preserving the
topology of the feature complex.


\section secTetRemeshingAPI API

The tetrahedral remeshing algorithm is implemented as a single free function that
takes only two parameters : the input triangulation, and the desired edge length,
which drives the remeshing process.

\ref BGLNamedParameters are used to deal with optional parameters.
The page \ref Remeshing_namedparameters describes their usage
and provides a list of the parameters that are used in this package for tuning
of the remeshing process and results.


\section secTetRemeshingExamples Examples

\subsection ssecEx1 Tetrahedral Remeshing Example

The following example shows the simplest use of the tetrahedral remeshing function.
The only needed parameter is a given target edge length that will drive the remeshing process
towards a high quality tetrahedral mesh with improved dihedral angles, and a more
uniform mesh, with edge lengths getting closer to the input parameter value.

\cgalExample{Tetrahedral_remeshing/tetrahedral_remeshing_example.cpp }


\subsection ssecEx2 Tetrahedral Remeshing of A Selection

Optional BGL named parameters can be used to get more precise
control on the remeshing process. In this example, a triangulation with two subdomains
(defined by indices stored in cells) is given as input, but only one
(defined by the `Subdomain_index` 2)
of its subdomains is remeshed.

\cgalExample{Tetrahedral_remeshing/tetrahedral_remeshing_of_one_subdomain.cpp }


\subsection ssecEx3 Tetrahedral Remeshing With Polyline Features

Optional BGL named parameters can be used to get more precise
control on the remeshing process. In this example, a triangulation
with polyline features that should be preserved - though resampled -
during the remeshing process.
