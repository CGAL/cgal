\section sms_sec_intro Introduction

<em>Movable Separability of Sets</em> \cgalCite{t-mss-85} is a class
of problems that deal with moving sets of objects, such as polygons in
the plane; the challange is to avoid collisions between the objects
while considering different kinds of motions and various definitions
of separation. The <em>moving sofa problem</em> or <em>sofa
problem</em> (see <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_sofa_problem">Moving sofa
problem</a> is a classic member of this class. It is a two-dimensional
idealisation of real-life furniture-moving problems; it asks for the
rigid two-dimensional shape of largest area \f$A\f$ that can be
maneuvered through an L-shaped planar region with legs of unit width
\cgalCite{w-sf-76}. The area \f$A\f$ thus obtained is referred to as
the sofa constant. The exact value of the sofa constant is an open
problem; see \cgalFigureRef{sms_2_fig_sofa_problem}. These problems
become progressively more challenging as the allowable set of
separation motions becomes more complex (have more degrees of
freedom), the number of objects involved grows, or the shape of the
objects becomes more complicated.

At this point this package provides solutions to one subclass of
problems related to 2D castings. In particular, each of these
solutions handles a single moving polygon and a single stationary
polygon, and considers a single translation of the moving polygon.

\section sms_sec_casting Casting

Casting is a manufacturing process where liquid material is poured
into a cavity inside a mold, which has the shape of a desired
product. After the material solidifies, the product is pulled out of
the mold. Typically a mold is used to manufacture numerous copies of a
product. The challenge is design a proper mold, such that the
solidified product can be separated from its mold without breaking it.

This package provides a function called
`single_mold_translational_casting_2()` that given a simple closed
polygon \f$P\f$ it determines whether a cavity (of a mold in the
plane) that has the shape of \f$P\f$ can be used so that the polygon
\f$P\f$ could be pulled out of the mold without colliding into the
mold (but possibly sliding along the mold surface); see
\cgalFigureRef{sms_2_fig_mold} for an illustration. If the polygon
is <em>castable</em>, the function computes the set of top edges of
such cavities and the corresponding closed ranges of pull
directions. Assuming the top edge normal is parallel to the
\f$y\f$-axis, every direction in a range must have a positive
component in the positive \f$y\f$-direction.

The input polygon must satisfy two conditions as follows. First, it
has to be simple. Essentially, a simple polygon is topologically
equivalent to a disk; see Chapter \ref
Chapter_2D_Regularized_Boolean_Set-Operations "2D Regularized Boolean
Set-Operations" for the precise definition of simple
polygons. Secondly, not consecuitive three vertices can be linear. If
you suspect that the input polygon may not satisfy the latter
condition, pre-process the polygon to elliminate this ill-condition.

The implementation is based on an algorithm developed by Shamai and
Halperin; see \cgalCite{cgal:ss-spfis-16} for the generalization of
the algorithm to 3D. The time and space complexities are in \f$O(n)\f$
and \f$O(1)\f$, respectively. In order to ensure robustness and
correctness you are adviced to use a kernel that guarantees exact
constructions as well as exact predicates.

\cgalExample{Set_movable_separability_2/single_mold_translational_casting.cpp}

This package also provides the following two functions: (i)
`is_top_edge_single_mold_translational_casting_2()` and (ii)
'top_edge_directions_single_mold_translational_casting_2().  The
former accepts a simple closed polygon \f$P\f$ and and edge \f$e\f$ of
the polygon. It determines whether \f$e\f$ is a top edge of
\f$P\f$. The latter accepts a simple closed polygon \f$P\f$ and a top
edge \f$e\f$ of \f$P\f$ and computes the range of pull
directions of \f$e\f$.
