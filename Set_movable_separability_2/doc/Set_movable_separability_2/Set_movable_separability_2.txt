\section sms_2_sec_intro Introduction

<em>Movable Separability of Sets</em> \cgalCite{t-mss-85} is a class
of problems that deal with moving sets of objects, such as polygons in
the plane; the challenge is to avoid collisions between the objects
while considering different kinds of motions and various definitions
of separation. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_sofa_problem">Moving sofa
problem</a> or <em>sofa problem</em> is a classic member of this
class. It is a two-dimensional idealization of real-life
furniture-moving problems; it asks for the rigid two-dimensional shape
of largest area \f$A\f$ that can be maneuvered through an L-shaped
planar region with legs of unit width \cgalCite{w-sf-76}. The area
\f$A\f$ thus obtained is referred to as the sofa constant. The exact
value of the sofa constant is an open problem; see
\cgalFigureRef{sms_2_fig_sofa_problem}. These problems become
progressively more challenging as the allowable set of separation
motions becomes more complex (have more degrees of freedom), the
number of objects involved grows, or the shape of the objects becomes
more complicated.

At this point this package provides solutions to one subclass of
problems related to 2D castings. In particular, each of these
solutions handles a single moving polygon and a single stationary
polygon, and considers a single translation of the moving polygon.

\section sms_2_sec_casting Casting

Casting is a manufacturing process where liquid material is poured
into a cavity inside a mold, which has the shape of a desired
product. (The mold can take any shape and form as long as it has a
cavity of the desired shape.) After the material solidifies, the
product is pulled out of the mold. Typically a mold is used to
manufacture numerous copies of a product. The challenge is designing a
proper mold, such that the solidified product can be separated from
its mold without breaking it.

This package provides a function called
`CGAL::Set_movable_separability_2::Single_mold_translational_casting::top_edges()`
that, given a simple closed polygon \f$P\f$, determines whether a
cavity (of a mold in the plane) that has the shape of \f$P\f$ can be
used so that the polygon \f$P\f$ could be pulled out of the mold
without colliding into the mold (but possibly sliding along the mold
boundary); see \cgalFigureRef{sms_2_fig_polygons} for an
illustration. In reality, the mold of a <em>castable</em> polygon must
be rotated before the polygon is casted, such that one edge becomes
parallel to the \f$x\f$-axis and is located above all other edges;
such an edge is referred to as a <em>top edge</em>. A polygon may have
up to four edges that can serve as top edges. If the polygon is
<em>castable</em>, the function computes the set of top edges of such
cavities and the corresponding closed ranges of pullout directions in
the plane.

The input polygon must satisfy two conditions as follows. First, it
has to be simple. Essentially, a simple polygon is topologically
equivalent to a disk; see Chapter \ref
Chapter_2D_Regularized_Boolean_Set-Operations
"2D Regularized Boolean Set-Operations" for the precise definition
of simple polygons. Secondly, any consecutive three vertices cannot be
collinear. If you suspect that the input polygon may not satisfy the
latter condition, pre-process the polygon to eliminate this
ill-condition.

The implementation is based on an algorithm developed by Shamai and
Halperin; see \cgalCite{cgal:ss-spfis-16} for the generalization of
the algorithm to 3D. The time and space complexities are in \cgalBigO{n}
and \cgalBigO{1}, respectively. In order to ensure robustness and
correctness you must use a kernel that guarantees exact
constructions as well as exact predicates, e,g,.
`Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel`.

The following example computes the top edges and their pullout
directions of an input polygon read from a file and reports the results.


\cgalExample{Set_movable_separability_2/top_edges_single_mold_trans_cast.cpp}

This package provides two additional functions, namely,
`CGAL::Set_movable_separability_2::Single_mold_translational_casting::pullout_directions()`
and
`CGAL::Set_movable_separability_2::Single_mold_translational_casting::is_pullout_direction()`.
The former accepts a simple closed polygon \f$P\f$ and an edge \f$e\f$
of the polygon \f$P\f$; it determines whether \f$e\f$ is a top edge of
\f$P\f$, and if so, it computes the range of pullout directions of
\f$e\f$. The latter is overloaded with two versions: The first version
accepts a simple closed polygon \f$P\f$ and a direction \f$d\f$; it
determines whether \f$d\f$ is a pullout direction of some top edge of
\f$P\f$. The other version accepts, in addition, an edge \f$e\f$ of
the polygon \f$P\f$; it determines whether \f$d\f$ is a pullout
direction of \f$e\f$.

Overloads of each of the functions above that accept (i) an additional
argument that indicates the orientation of the input polygon or (ii) an
additional traits argument, or (iii) both, are also provided by the package.
