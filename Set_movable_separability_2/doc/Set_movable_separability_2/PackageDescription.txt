\cgalPkgDesc{<em>Movable Separability of Sets</em> \cgalCite{t-mss-85} is a
class of problems that deal with moving sets of objects, such as polygons in
the plane; the challenge is to avoid collisions between the objects
while considering different kinds of motions and various definitions
of separation.}

At this point this package consists of the implementations of various predicates and constructions related to castings of polygonal objects. In particular, it can be used to determine whether a feasible mold for a polygonal object does exist. If a mold exists, the package can also be used to compute all possible orientations of the feasible molds and the corresponding motions needed to remove the casted object from the mold.
