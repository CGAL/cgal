Movable Separability of Sets is a class of problems that deal with moving sets of objects, such as polygons in the plane; the challange is to avoid collisions between the objects while considering different kinds of motions and various definitions of separation. At this point this package provides solutions to one subclass of problems related to 2D castings. In particular, each of these solutions handles a single moving polygon and a single stationary polygon, and considers a single translation of the moving polygon.

The casting process is a form of manufacturing, where liquid material is poured into a mold, it solidifies, and then the object is pulled from the mold. The mold has to be designed in such a way that the object can be removed without breaking the mold. This is not always possible (e.g., a circle).

This package consists of the implementations of various predicates and operations related to castings of polygonal objects. In particular, it can be used to determine whether a mold for a polygonal object does exist. If a mold exists, the package can also used to compute all possible orientations of the feasible molds and the corresponding motions needed to remove the casted object from the mold.
