This component takes a 3D triangle mesh, a triangle soup, or a point set as input, and generates
a valid triangulated surface mesh that strictly contains the input (watertight, intersection-free
and 2-manifold). The algorithm proceeds by shrink-wrapping and refining a 3D Delaunay triangulation
loosely bounding the input. Two user-defined parameters, alpha and offset, offer control over the maximum size
of cavities where the shrink-wrapping process can enter, and the tightness of the final surface mesh
to the input, respectively. Once combined, these parameters provide a means to trade fidelity
to the input for complexity of the output.
