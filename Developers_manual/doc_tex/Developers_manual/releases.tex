\section{Internal Releases\label{sec:internal_releases}}
\ccIndexSubitem{releases}{internal}

Internal releases are currently created daily from a script run
at GeometryFactory.  This script packages together the current versions of all
packages into a tar file and publish a tarball at
\path'http://cgal.geometryfactory.com/CGAL/Members/Releases/'.
People responsible for running the test suite can pick it up automatically
using the {\tt autotest\_cgal} script (Section~\ref{sec:autotest_cgal}).

\section{Public Releases\label{sec:public_releases}}
\ccIndexSubitem{releases}{public}

A public release can be created from an internal release by following the
steps detailed in the
\texttt{README} file in the package \texttt{Release} on the SVN server.
\index{SVN server!Release package@\texttt{Release} package}
This file describes how to create the code, the documentation and the
updated web pages for a new release.

Each public release is tagged on the SVN server with a tag in the following
format \texttt{CGAL\_N\_release}, where \texttt{N} is the release number
with all `.'s replaced by `\_'s (\eg, for release 3.0, the tag is
\texttt{CGAL\_3\_0\_release}.  There is also a branch created for
each release with the name \texttt{CGAL\_N\_branch}, where \texttt{N} is
the release number as before.  This facilitates the creation of bug fix
releases.
