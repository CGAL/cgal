\section{Internal Releases}
\label{sec:internal_releases}
\ccIndexSubitem{releases}{internal}

Internal releases are currently created 2 or 3 times a week from a script run
at INRIA.  This script packages together the current versions of all
packages into a tar file and then sends a mail to {\tt cgal-develop}.
People responsible for running the test suite can pick it up automatically
using the {\tt autotest\_cgal} script (Section~\ref{sec:autotest_cgal}).

\section{Public Releases}
\label{sec:public_releases}
\ccIndexSubitem{releases}{public}

A public release can be created from an internal release by following the
steps detailed in the
\texttt{README} file in the package \texttt{Release} on the CVS server.
\index{CVS server!Release package@\texttt{Release} package}
This file describes how to create the code, the documentation and the
updated web pages for a new release.

Each public release is tagged on the CVS server with a tag in the following
format \texttt{CGAL\_N\_release}, where \texttt{N} is the release number
with all `.'s replaced by `\_'s (\eg, for release 3.0, the tag is
\texttt{CGAL\_3\_0\_release}.  There is also a branch tag created for
each release with the name \texttt{CGAL\_N\_branch}, where \texttt{N} is
the release number as before.  This facilitates the creation of bug fix
releases.
