\cgalPkgDesc{This package provides classes for manipulating
triangulations (pure simplicial complexes) in Euclidean spaces whose dimension
can be specified at compile-time or at run-time. Specifically, it provides a
data structure to store the triangulations, and two classes to handle
triangulations and Delaunay triangulations of point sets. Point location and point
insertion are supported. The Delaunay triangulation also supports point removal.}

A triangulation is a pure manifold simplicial complex.
Its faces are simplices such that two of them either do not
intersect or share a common face.

The triangulation classes of \cgal are designed to
represent triangulations of a set of points \f$ A\f$ in
\f$ \mathbb{R}^d\f$. It can be
viewed as a partition of the convex hull of \f$ A\f$ into simplices whose
vertices are the points of \f$ A\f$.

See the \ref Chapter_Triangulations "User Manual" for more details.

<!---
In order to deal only with full dimensional simplices (full cells),
which is convenient for many
applications, the space outside the convex hull is subdivided into
full cells by
considering that each convex hull facet is incident to an infinite
full cell having as vertex an auxiliary vertex called the infinite
vertex. In that way, each facet is incident to exactly two full cells and
special cases at the boundary of the convex hull are simple to deal
with.

A triangulation is represented as a collection of vertices
and full cells that are linked
together through incidence and adjacency relations. Each full cell gives
access to its incident vertices and to its adjacent
full cells. Each vertex gives access to one of its incident full cells.

The vertices of a full cell are indexed in positive
orientation, the positive orientation being defined by the orientation
of the underlying Euclidean space \f$ \mathbb{R}^d\f$.
The neighbors of a full cell are also
indexed  in such a way that the neighbor indexed by \f$ i\f$
is opposite to the vertex with the same index.
