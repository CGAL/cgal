\ingroup PkgTriangulationsTriangulationClasses

This class is used to maintain the
Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in \f$ \mathbb{R}^D \f$.
It permits point insertion and
removal. The maximal dimension \f$ D\f$ can be specified at compile-time or
run-time. It should be kept reasonably small,
see the performance section in the user manual for what reasonable
means.

In a Delaunay triangulation, each face has the so-called
<I>Delaunay</I> or <I>empty-ball</I> property: there exists a
circumscribing ball whose interior does not contain
any vertex of the triangulation.
A <I>circumscribing ball</I> of a simplex is a ball
having all vertices of the simplex on its boundary.


\tparam DelaunayTriangulationTraits_ is the geometric traits class that provides the geometric types
and predicates needed by Delaunay triangulations. `DelaunayTriangulationTraits_` must be a model of
the concept `DelaunayTriangulationTraits`.

\tparam TriangulationDataStructure_ must be a model of the concept
`TriangulationDataStructure`. This model is used to store
the faces of the triangulation. The parameter `TriangulationDataStructure_` defaults to
`Triangulation_data_structure` whose template parameters are instantiated as
follows:
<UL>
<LI>`DelaunayTriangulationTraits_::Dimension`</LI>
<LI>`Triangulation_vertex<DelaunayTriangulationTraits_>`</LI>
<LI>`Triangulation_full_cell<DelaunayTriangulationTraits_>`.</LI>
</UL>

\tparam Delaunay_triangulation can
be defined by specifying only the first parameter, or by using the
tag `CGAL::Default` as the second parameter.

Inserts the point `p` in the Delaunay triangulation

Returns a handle to the

`p` is inserted so as to increase the current dimension of the Delaunay
triangulation.

is set to `p`. `v` is returned. <DT><B>Anything else</B><DD> The point `p`
is inserted. the full cell `c` <I>is assumed</I> to be in conflict
with `p`.
</DL>
The parameters `lt`, `f`, `ft`
and `c` must be consistent with the localization of point `p` in the
Delaunay triangulation e.g. by a call to
`Triangulation::locate(const Point &, Locate_type &, Face &, Vertex_handle) const`.
