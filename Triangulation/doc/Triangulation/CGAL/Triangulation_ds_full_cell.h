\ingroup PkgTriangulationsVertexCellClasses

This class is the default model used for the
full cell of the class `Triangulation_data_structure`.

This class does not provide any geometric capabilities but only combinatorial
(adjacency) information. Thus, if the `Triangulation_data_structure` is
used as a parameter of an (embedded) `Triangulation`, then its full cell template
parameter has to fulfill additional geometric requirements, i.e. it has to be
a model of the refined concept `TriangulationFullCell`.

This class can be used directly or can serve as a base to derive other classes
with some additional attributes tuned for a specific application.


\tparam TriangulationDataStructure_ must be a model of the
`TriangulationDataStructure` concept.

\tparam TriangulationDSFullCellStoragePolicy indicates whether or not
the full cell should additionally store the mirror indices (the indices
of the mirror vertices). This improves speed a little, but takes
more space.<br>
The class template `Triangulation_ds_full_cell` accepts that no second parameter be specified.
It also accepts the tag `CGAL::Default` as second parameter. Both cases are
equivalent to setting `TriangulationDSFullCellStoragePolicy` to
`CGAL::TDS_full_cell_default_storage_policy`. <br>

When the second parameter is specified, its possible values
are:<UL>
<LI>`CGAL::Default`, which is the default value. In that case, the
policy `CGAL::TDS_full_cell_default_storage_policy` is used (i.e.\ the mirror
indices are not stored).
<LI>`CGAL::TDS_full_cell_default_storage_policy`. In that case, the mirror
indices are not stored.
<LI>`CGAL::TDS_full_cell_mirror_storage_policy`. In that case, the mirror
indices are stored.
</UL>
See the user manual for how to choose the second option.
