\ingroup PkgTriangulationsVertexCellClasses

The class `Triangulation_ds_vertex` serves as the default vertex template parameter in the
class `Triangulation_data_structure<Dimensionality, TriangulationDSVertex_, TriangulationDSFullCell_>`.

This class does not contain any geometric information but only combinatorial
(adjacency) information. Thus, if the `Triangulation_data_structure` is
used as a parameter of a (embedded) `Triangulation`, then its vertex template parameter
has to fulfill additional geometric requirements, i.e., it has to be a
model of the refined concept `TriangulationVertex`.

This class can be used directly or can serve as a base to derive other classes
with some additional attributes tuned for a specific application (a color for
example).


\tparam TriangulationDataStructure_ must be a model of the
`TriangulationDataStructure` concept.

\cgalHeading{Rebind mechanism}

In case of derivation from that class, the nested class
`Rebind_TDS` need to be provided in the derived class.
