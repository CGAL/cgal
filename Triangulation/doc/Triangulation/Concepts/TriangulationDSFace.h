\cgalConcept

A `TriangulationDSFace` describes a face `f` with dimension `k`
(a `k`-face) in a triangulation.
It gives access to a handle to a full cell `c` containing the face
`f` in its boundary, as well as the indices of the vertices of `f` in
`c`. It must hold that `f` is a <I>proper</I> face of full cell
`c`, i.e., the dimension of `f` is strictly less than
the dimension of `c`.
The dimension of a face is implicitely set when
`TriangulationDSFace::set_index` is called. For example, if
`TriangulationDSFace::set_index` is called two times to set the
first two vertices (`i = 0` and `i = 1`), then the dimension is 1.
