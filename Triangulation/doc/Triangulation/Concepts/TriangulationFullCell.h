The concept `TriangulationFullCell` describes the requirements on the type used by the
class `CGAL::Triangulation<TriangulationTraits_, TriangulationDataStructure_>`, and its derived classes, to
represent a full cell.

\cgalRefines{TriangulationDSFullCell We only list below the
additional specific requirements of `TriangulationFullCell`}
