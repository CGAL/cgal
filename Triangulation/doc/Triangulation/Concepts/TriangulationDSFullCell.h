\cgalConcept

The concept `TriangulationDSFullCell` describes the requirements for the
full cell class of a `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure`. It refines
the concept `TriangulationDataStructure::FullCell`.

Since the `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure` is the class
which defines the handle
types, the full cell base class has to be somehow
parameterized by the triangulation
data structure. But since the `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure`
itself is parameterized by the cell and vertex
base classes, there is a cycle in the definition of these classes.
In order
to break the cycle, the base classes for cells and vertices
which are plugged in to instantiate a
`Triangulation_data_structure`
use a `void` as triangulation
data structure parameter. Then,
the `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure`
uses a <I>rebind</I> mechanism (similar to the one specified in
`std::allocator`) in order to plug itself
as parameter in the full cell and vertex base classes.
This mechanism requires that the base class provides
a templated nested class `Rebind_TDS` that
itself provides
the subtype `Rebind_TDS::Other`
which is the <I>rebound</I> version of the base class.
This <I>rebound</I> base class is the class
that the `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure`
actually uses as a base class for the class
of `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure::Vertex`.
