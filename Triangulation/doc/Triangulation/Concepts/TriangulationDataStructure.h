\cgalConcept

The `TriangulationDataStructure` concept describes objects responsible for
storing and maintaining the combinatorial part of a
\f$ d\f$-dimensional pure simplicial complex that has the topology
of the \f$ d\f$-dimensional sphere \f$ \mathbb{S}^d\f$ with \f$ d\in[-2,D]\f$.
Since the simplicial \f$ d\f$-complex is pure, all
faces are sub-faces of some \f$ d\f$-simplex. And since it has the
topology of the sphere \f$ \mathbb{S}^d\f$, it is manifold, thus
any \f$ d-1\f$-face belongs to exactly two \f$ d\f$-dimensional full cells.

The concept `TriangulationDataStructure` includes two sub-concepts
`TriangulationDataStructure::Vertex` and
`TriangulationDataStructure::FullCell`.

Possible values for the current dimension \f$ d\f$ include

<DL>
<DT><B>-2</B><DD> This corresponds to the non-existence of any object in
the triangulation.
<DT><B>-1</B><DD> This corresponds to a single vertex and a single full cell,
which is also the unique vertex and the unique full cell in the
`TriangulationDataStructure`.
In a
geometric realization of the `TriangulationDataStructure` (<I>e.g.</I>, in a
`Triangulation<TriangulationTraits_, TriangulationDataStructure_>` or a
`Delaunay_triangulation<DelaunayTriangulationTraits_, TriangulationDataStructure_>`), this vertex
corresponds to <I>the vertex at infinity</I>.

<DT><B>0</B><DD> This corresponds to two vertices, each incident to one \f$ 0\f$-face;
the two full cells being neighbors of each other. This is the unique
triangulation of the \f$ 0\f$-sphere.

<DT><B>\f$ d>0\f$</B><DD> This corresponds to a triangulation of the sphere
\f$ \mathbb{S}^d\f$.
</DL>

An \f$ i\f$-simplex is a simplex with \f$ i+1\f$ vertices. An \f$ i\f$-simplex \f$ \sigma\f$ is
incident to a \f$ j\f$-simplex \f$ \sigma'\f$, \f$ j<i\f$, if and only if \f$ \sigma'\f$
is a proper face of \f$ \sigma\f$.

We call a \f$ 0\f$-simplex a <I>vertex</I>, a \f$ (d-1)\f$-simplex a <I>facet</I> and a
\f$ d\f$-simplex a <I>full cell</I>. A <I>face</I> can have any dimension.
Two full cells are <I>neighbors</I> if they share a facet. Two faces are
<I>incident</I> if one is included in the other.

\cgalHeading{Input/Output}

The information stored in the `iostream` is:

- the current dimension (which must be smaller than or equal to `tds.maximal_dimension()`),

- the number of vertices,

- for each vertex the information of that vertex,

- the number of full cells,

- for each full cell the indices of its vertices and extra information for that full cell,

- for each full cell the indices of its neighbors.

The indices of vertices and full cells correspond to the order in the
file; the user cannot control it.
The classes `Vertex` and
`Full_cell` have to provide the relevant I/O operators
(possibly empty).

The concept `TriangulationDataStructure::FullCell` describes the type used by a
`TriangulationDataStructure` to store the full cells.

It sets requirements of combinatorial nature
only, as geometry is not concerned here.
In the context of triangulation, the term full cell refers to a face of
<I>maximal</I> dimension. This maximality characteristic is emphasized by using
the adjective <I>full</I>.

A `TriangulationDataStructure::FullCell` is responsible for
storing handles to the vertices of the
full cell as well as handles to the adjacent full cells. Two full cells
are said to be adjacent when they share a facet. Adjacent full cells are
called hereafter neighbors.
