This package contains the documentation of the Polygon_mesh_processing functions
that perform Boolean operations on triangulated surface meshes;
clipping and splitting of meshes using planes, boxes, or other meshes;
and slicing of meshes with planes.

The implementations are located in the `Polygon_mesh_processing` package.
