\cgalConcept

The concept `AABBPrimitive` describes the requirements for the primitives stored in the AABB tree data structure. The concept encapsulates a type for the input datum (a geometric object) and an identifier (id) type through which those primitives are referred to. The concept `AABBPrimitive` also refines the concepts DefaultConstructible and Assignable.

\cgalHeading{Example}

The `Primitive` type can be, e.g., a wrapper around a `Handle`. Assume for instance that the input objects are the triangle faces of a mesh stored as a `CGAL::Polyhedron_3`. The `Datum` would be a `Triangle_3` and the `Id` would be a polyhedron `Face_handle`. Method `datum()` can return either a `Triangle_3` constructed on the fly from the face handle or a `Triangle_3` stored internally. This provides a way for the user to trade memory for efficiency.
