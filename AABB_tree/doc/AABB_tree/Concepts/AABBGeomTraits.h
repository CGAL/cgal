\ingroup PkgAABBTreeConcepts
\cgalConcept

The concept `AABBGeomTraits` defines the requirements for the first template parameter of the class
`CGAL::AABB_traits<AABBGeomTraits, AABBPrimitive>`. It provides predicates and constructors to detect
and compute intersections between query objects and the primitives stored in the AABB tree.
In addition, it contains predicates and constructors to compute distances between a point query
and the primitives stored in the AABB tree.

A functor object to detect intersections between two geometric objects.

must be a `boost::optional` of a `boost::variant` of the possible intersection types.
