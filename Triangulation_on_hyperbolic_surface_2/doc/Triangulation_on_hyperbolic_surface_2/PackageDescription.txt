\cgalPkgDesc{This package enables building and handling triangulations of closed orientable hyperbolic surfaces. Functionalities are offered such as the Delaunay flip algorithm, and the construction of a portion of the lift of the triangulation in the Poincaré disk model of the hyperbolic plane. Triangulations can be generated by triangulating a convex fundamental domain in the Poincaré disk model. A method is offered that generates such domains in genus 2.}

\cgalCRPSection{Concepts}

- `HyperbolicSurfaceTraits_2` is the concept for the template parameter of most classes of the package.
- `ComplexNumber` describes a complex number type.

\cgalCRPSection{Classes}

- `CGAL::Triangulation_on_hyperbolic_surface_2` represents a triangulation of a closed orientable hyperbolic surface. It offers functionalities such as the generation of the triangulation from a convex fundamental domain, the Delaunay flip algorithm, and the construction of a portion of the lift of the triangulation in the hyperbolic plane.

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_fundamental_domain_2` represents a fundamental domain of a closed orientable hyperbolic surface.

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_fundamental_domain_factory_2` is a factory class, whose purpose is to generate some convex domains of surfaces of genus 2.

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_isometry_2` represents an isometry in the Poincaré disk model. Facilities are offered to compose isometries, and apply an isometry to a point.

Models for `HyperbolicSurfaceTraits_2` and `ComplexNumber` are provided: `CGAL::Hyperbolic_surface_traits_2` and `CGAL::Complex_number`.
