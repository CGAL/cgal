\cgalPkgDesc{This package provides a (1D) curve skeleton extraction algorithm for a triangulated polygonal mesh without borders based on the mean curvature flow.
        The particularity of this skeleton is that it captures the topology of the input.
        For each skeleton vertex one can obtain its location and its corresponding vertices from the input mesh.
        The code is generic and works with any model of the `FaceListGraph`
        concept.

 \todo doc+code: mention that to get a better skeleton that is closer to the medial axis,
                 the surface must be sufficiently well sampled so that the Voronoi poles lie on the media axis (see Amenta's paper).
                 Propose the usage of the isotropic remeshing and see if we add a boolean to do it automatically in the api (correspondance would be broken)
 \todo code: implement the random sampling of surface using the work started by Alexandru during its gsoc to get a better approximation of poles
 \todo code: expose in polygon mesh processing the function to compute the voronoi pole of a close triangle mesh
 \todo code: expose in polygon mesh processing the function to remesh locally a triangle mesh with the angle and edge length parameters
 \todo code: avoid using EPEC for the triangulation
