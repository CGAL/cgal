The class `CORE::Expr` provides exact computation over the subset of real
numbers that contains integers, and which is closed by the operations
\f$ +,-,\times,/,\sqrt{}\f$ and \f$\sqrt[k]{}\f$. Operations and comparisons
between objects of this type are guaranteed to be exact.
This number type is provided by the
\core library \cgalCite{klpy-clp-99}.

\cgal defines the necessary functions so that this class complies to the
requirements on number types.
