\ingroup nt_leda

The class `leda_real` is a wrapper class that provides the functions needed
to use the number type `real`, representing exact real numbers
numbers provided by \leda.
The class `leda_real` provides exact computation over the subset of real
numbers that contains integers, and which is closed by the operations
\f$ +,-,\times,/,\sqrt{}\f$ and \f$\sqrt[k]{}\f$. For \leda version 5.0 or later
`leda_real` is also able to represent real roots of polynomials.
Operations and comparisons between objects of this type are guaranteed
to be exact.

\cgalModels `RealEmbeddable`
\cgalModels `FromDoubleConstructible`

For more details on the number types of \leda we refer to the \leda manual \cgalCite{cgal:as-lum}.
