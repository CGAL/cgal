\ingroup nt_gmp

An object of the class `Gmpfr` is a fixed precision floating-point
number, based on the \mpfr library. This type is inexact, due to the fact
that the mantissa of each number is represented by a fixed amount of bits
(this amount is called <I>precision</I>). If an operation needs more bits
than the precision of the result number, the results are rounded following
different possible criteria (called <I>rounding modes</I>).

Currently, the `Gmpfr` interface supports four rounding modes: round to nearest,
round toward zero, round down (or toward \f$ (-\infty)\f$) and round up
(or toward \f$ (+\infty)\f$). When not specified explicitly, the
operations use the default rounding mode, which is in practice a
variable local to each execution thread. The default rounding mode
can be set to any of the four rounding modes (initially, it is set
to nearest). To specify rounding modes for operations, the type
used is `std::float_round_style`.

This type is `ImplicitInteroperable` with `Gmpz`, <TT>long</TT>,
<TT>unsigned long</TT>, <TT>int</TT>, <TT>double</TT> and <TT>long double</TT>.

\cgalHeading{Comparisons}

Comparison operators `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`,
`>=` and `<=` are also overloaded. A `Gmpfr` can
be compared with other `Gmpfr`, as well as with a `Gmpz`,
`long`, `unsigned long`, `int`, `double` or
`long double`. It is worth noting that the numbers are never
converted nor rounded before comparison. In the case where one of
the compared numbers is `NaN`, the `erange` flag is set.

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

Since the \mpfr library can be compiled to be thread-safe, this interface
is designed to keep the thread-safety.

`Gmpfr`s are reference counted. This behavior may be changed, by
setting the flag <TT>CGAL_GMPFR_NO_REFCOUNT</TT>. A non-reference-counted
class is slightly more efficient in case the implementation does not need
to copy numbers (this is not usually the case). Nevertheless, setting this
flag may be useful for debugging purposes.

Each Gmpfr object has a precision associated to it. The precision is
the amount of bits needed to represent the mantissa.
\mpfr has a default precision value, which can be
controlled by static functions of the Gmpfr class (in practice, this
default value is a variable local to each execution thread). There are
also functions to get and set the precision of each Gmpfr object.

/*! \name Flags

\mpfr provides some flags to know whether
performed operations were exact or not, or they incurred in overflow
or underflow, if the exponent is out of range, or the result was `NaN`
(not-a-number). One can clear the flags before a set of operations and
inspect them afterward, in order to see if something unexpected
happened during the operations. The static functions used to handle
flags are:

has an invalid result. For example, this flag will be set if
one of the operands of a comparison is `NaN`.

/*! \name Arithmetic Operations

 Arithmetic operators `+` , `-` , and `/` are overloaded, but special
 care must be taken when applying them. The precision of an operation
 between two `Gmpfr`s is defined as the maximum of the operands
 precision and the default precision. The second operand of the former
 operations can be a `Gmpfr`, `int`, `long`, `unsigned`, `unsigned
 long`, or `Gmpz`. The precision of an operation between a `Gmpfr` and
 a number of another type is defined as the maximum between the
 number's precision and the default precision. To specify the rounding
 mode and/or the precision to perform an operation, this class
 provides the four static functions `add`, `sub`, `mul` and
 `div`. Only one of them is shown here, since their interfaces are
 similar: When the precision is not specified in this family of
 functions, it is defined as in the overloaded operators. When the
 rounding mode is not specified, the default is used.
