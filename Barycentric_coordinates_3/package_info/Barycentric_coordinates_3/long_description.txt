The package 3D Generalized Barycentric Coordinates offers an efficient and robust implementation of three-dimensional closed-form generalized barycentric coordinates defined for convex simplicial polytopes. If coordinates with respect to multivariate scattered points instead of a polygon are required, please refer to natural neighbour coordinates from the package 2D and Surface Function Interpolation.
