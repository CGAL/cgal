This chapter describes the Homological Discrete Vector Field (HDVF) package: a framework for "geometric" homology computation introduced by Aldo Gonzalez-Lorenzo in his PhD (see [AGL,2017], [AGL,2016]).

HDVFs provide tools to compute basic homological information (such as Betti numbers, ie. number of holes per dimension), but also higher level information (homology and cohomology generators, homology/cohomology annotation...). Moreover HDVFs provide persistent homology computation tools as well as Alexander duality and relative homology tools.

A chain complex is an algebraic structure, associated to a given geometric complex (such as a simplicial, a cubical or a cellular complex) encoding cells in each dimension (through groups) and adjacency between such cells (through morphisms called boundary maps).
