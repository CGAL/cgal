\cgalPkgDesc{This package provides functors for constructing two kinds of cone-based spanners:
Yao graph and Theta graph, given a set of vertices on the plane and the directions of cone boundaries.
Both exact and inexact constructions are supported.
In exact construction, the cone boundaries are calculated using the roots of polynomials,
thus avoiding the use of \f$ \pi \f$, which cannot be represented exactly.
In inexact construction, the cone boundaries are calculated using the approximate \f$ \pi \f$
value defined in \cgal, which is still accurate enough for most applications.
Moreover, for visualization purpose, this package provides a global function to
generate the data and script files used by Gnuplot to plot the constructed graphs.
This package also provides options for the Half Yao graph and the Half Theta graph.}
