\section sec_CBS_Introduction Introduction

This chapter describes the package for constructing two kinds of cone-based spanners:
<i>Yao graph</i> and <i>Theta graph</i>, given a set of vertices on the plane and the directions of cone boundaries.
Both exact and inexact constructions are supported.
In exact construction, the cone boundaries are calculated using roots of polynomials,
which achieves the exactness by avoiding using \f$ \pi \f$ in the computation.
In inexact construction, the cone boundaries are calculated with a floating point
approximation of \f$ \pi \f$ value and is still accurate
enough for most applications.
Moreover, for visualization purpose, this chapter describes a global function
that, given a constructed graph as input, can generate the data and script files for \gnuplot
to plot that graph.

\section sec_CBS_mydefinitions Definitions

This section gives detailed definitions of Yao graph and Theta graph, which are followed
in our implementation. In particular, because this package supports constructing Yao graph
and Theta graph exactly, we need to be clear on which cone a cone boundary belongs to.
The definitions presented here clarify on this.

Given a set \f$V\f$ of vertices on the plane, the directed Yao Graph with an integer
parameter \f$k (k > 1)\f$ on \f$V\f$ is obtained as follows. For each vertex \f$u \in V\f$,
starting from a given direction (e.g., the direction of positive \f$x\f$-axis),
draw \f$k\f$ equally-spaced rays \f$l_0\f$, \f$l_1\f$, ..., \f$l_{k-1}\f$ originating
from \f$u\f$ in counterclockwise order (see \cgalFigureRef{f-y5} (a)).
These rays divide the plane into \f$k\f$ cones of angle \f$2\pi/k\f$,
denoted by \f$ c(u, 0), c(u, 1), ..., c(u, k-1)\f$ respectively in counterclockwise order.
To avoid overlapping at boundaries, it is stipulated here that the area of \f$ c(u, i)\f$,
where \f$ i=0, \ldots, k-1\f$,  includes the ray \f$l_{i}\f$ but excludes the ray \f$l_{(i+1)\% k}\f$.
In each cone of \f$u\f$, draw a directed edge from \f$u\f$ to its closest vertex by
Euclidean distance in that cone. Ties are broken arbitrarily. These directed edges will form the
edge set of the directed Yao graph on \f$V\f$. The undirected Yao Graph on \f$V\f$ is obtained by
ignoring the directions of the edges. Note that if both edge \f$uv\f$ and \f$vu\f$ are in the
directed Yao graph, only one edge \f$uv\f$ exists in the undirected Yao graph.
\cgalFigureRef{f-y5} (b) gives an example of Yao graph with \f$k=5\f$.

Cones and an example of Yao Graph with \f$k=5\f$.
\cgalFigureEnd

Similar to Yao graph, the directed or undirected Theta Graph is also obtained by letting each
vertex \f$u \in V\f$ select a <i>closest</i> vertex in each of its cones to have an edge.
The only difference is that <i>closest</i> in Theta Graph means the smallest projection distance
onto the bisector of that cone, not the direct Euclidean distance. For instance,
in \cgalFigureRef{f-theta}, vertex \f$u\f$'s <i>closest</i> vertex will be vertex \f$b\f$.

\section sec_CBS_design Software Design
This package provides the following template functors:

- `Compute_cone_boundaries_2`: The functor for computing the directions of cone boundaries
  given a cone number and an initial direction.
- `Construct_theta_graph_2`: The functor for constructing Theta graphs given a set of vertices
  on the plane.
- `Construct_yao_graph_2`: The functor for constructing Yao graphs given a set of vertices
  on the plane.

In addition to these functors, for visualizing the constructed graphs, this package provides a global function
called `CGAL::gnuplot_output_2()` to output a `boost::adjacency_list` data structure to \gnuplot data and script files.
Below, we detail the design and the usage of the above functors and function.

\subsection subsec_CBS_cone Computing Cone Boundaries

The functor `Compute_cone_boundaries_2` has the following definition.

\code{.cpp}
    template <typename Traits>
    class Compute_cone_boundaries_2;
\endcode

The template parameter `Traits` determines whether the cone boundaries are computed
exactly or inexactly. If this parameter is `Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel_with_root_of`,
the computation will be done exactly; if this parameter is
`Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel`, the computation will be done inexactly.
The exact computation is implemented based on the fact that
when the cone angle \f$ \theta \f$ is in the form of \f$ 2\pi / n \f$,
where \f$ n \f$ is a positive integer, \f$ \sin(\theta) \f$ and \f$ \cos(\theta) \f$
can be represented exactly by roots of polynomials, thus avoiding using \f$ \pi \f$
in the computation. The exact computation requires the number type of either `CORE::Expr`
or `leda_real`.
In inexact computation, the cone angle \f$ \theta \f$ is
simply calculated as \f$ 2\pi/k \f$, where \f$ k \f$ is the number of cones and
\f$ \pi \f$ takes the value of the constant `CGAL_PI=3.14159265358979323846`.
Then, the \f$ \sin(\theta) \f$ and \f$ \cos(\theta) \f$ are calculated.
While the inexact computation is done by the general functor
definition, the exact computation is done by a specialization of this functor.

<!--
The operator() of this functor is defined as follows:
\code{.cpp}
void operator()(const unsigned int k,
                Direction_2& initial_direction,
                std::vector<Direction_2>& rays)
\endcode
The parameter `k` is used to give the number of cones, and the
parameter `initial_direction` the direction of the ray \f$l_0\f$ as defined in
the first section, which allows the cones have arbitrary orientation. The
parameter `rays` is used to return the computation results, which stores a vector
of directions for the rays from \f$l_0\f$ to \f$l_{k-1}\f$ respectively.
-->

This functor is currently used by the functors
`Construct_theta_graph_2` and `Construct_yao_graph_2`
in constructing Theta and Yao graphs. This functor can also be used in other applications where the plane needs to be
divided into equally-angled cones. For how to use this functor to compute cone boundaries in writing an application,
please refer to Section \ref sec_CBS_examples.

\subsection subsec_CBS_theta Constructing a Theta Graph

The functor `Construct_theta_graph_2` has the following definition

\code{.cpp}
    template <typename Traits, typename Graph>
    class Construct_theta_graph_2;
\endcode

Similar to the functor `Compute_cone_boundaries_2`, the template parameter `Traits`
determines whether the Theta graph will constructed exactly or inexactly.
The template parameter `Graph` specifies the graph type used to store the constructed graph.
Our package requires it to be
<a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/adjacency_list.html">boost::adjacency_list</a>
from the Boost Graph Library (BGL).
The advantage of using `boost::adjacency_list` is that it provides convenience
to the further processing of the constructed graphs, since BGL includes most common graph algorithms.
Note that BGL altogether provides two template classes for representing graphs:
`boost::adjacency_list` and `boost::adjacency_matrix`, with the former suitable for
sparse graphs and the latter suitable for dense graphs. While cone-based spanners
are sparse graphs and the interfaces provided by `boost::adjacency_list` and `boost::adjacency_matrix`
are different, our package only supports `boost::adjacency_list`.

Note that there are seven template parameters for `boost::adjacency_list` in BGL: `OutEdgeList`, `VertexList`,
`Directed`, `VertexProperties`, `EdgeProperties`, `GraphProperties`, `EdgeList`,
of which we require `VertexProperties` to be `Traits::Point_2`,
and other parameters can be chosen freely.
Also note that, here we pass `Point_2` directly as
<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/graph/doc/bundles.html"><i>bundled properties</i></a>
to `boost::adjacency_list`, because this makes our implementation more straightforward than using a property map.
If you want more properties other than `Point_2` for vertices, you can still
construct external properties by using property maps.

In constructing Theta graphs, this functor uses the algorithm from
Chapter 4 of the book by Narasimhan and Smid \cgalCite{cgal:ns-gsn-07}.
Basically, it is a sweep line algorithm and uses a
balanced search tree to store the vertices that have already been scanned.
It has the complexity of \f$O(n \log n)\f$, where \f$n\f$ is the number of vertices in the plane.
This complexity has been proved to be optimal.

For more details on how to use this `Construct_theta_graph_2` functor to write an application to build Theta graphs,
please refer to Section \ref sec_CBS_examples.

\subsection subsec_CBS_yao Constructing a Yao Graph

The functor `Construct_yao_graph_2` has a similar definition as `Construct_theta_graph_2`.


\code{.cpp}
    template <typename Traits, typename Graph>
    class Construct_yao_graph_2;
\endcode

The way of using these two template parameters is the same as that of `Construct_theta_graph_2`,
so please refer to the previous subsection for the details. We note here that construction algorithm for Yao graph
is a slight adaptation of the algorithm for constructing Theta graph, having a complexity of \f$O(n^2)\f$.
The increase of complexity in this adaptation is because in constructing Theta graph,
the searching of the 'closest' node by projection distance can be done by a balanced search tree,
but in constructing Yao graph, the searching of the 'closest' node by Euclidean distance cannot be
done by a balanced search tree.

Note that an optimal algorithm for constructing Yao graph with a complexity of \f$O(n \log n)\f$ is
described in \cgalCite{cgal:cht-oacov-90}. However, this algorithm is much more complex to implement than
the current algorithm implemented, and it can hardly reuse the codes for constructing Theta graphs,
so it is not implemented in this package right now.

\subsection subsec_CBS_gnuplot Gnuplot Output

This package also implements a template function `CGAL::gnuplot_output_2()`, which reads a
`boost::adjacency_list` object and generate two files used by \gnuplot to visualize the graph stored
in the `boost::adjacency_list` object. This template function has the following definition:

\code{.cpp}
    template <typename Graph_>
    void gnuplot_output_2(const Graph_& g, const std::string& prefix);
\endcode

The template parameter `Graph_` specifies the type of the graph to be plotted. For this function to work,
the graph type must be `boost::adjacency_list` with `Point_2` as the `VertexProperties`.
As for the two arguments to the function, `g` gives the graph to be plotted, and `prefix` gives the
prefix for the names of the files generated by the function. Specifically, this function will
generate the following two files:
- A data file named `prefix.v` that contains the \f$(x, y)\f$-coordinates
  of each vertex. To be read by \gnuplot,
  the \f$(x, y)\f$-coordinates are written into the data file with decimal format,
  no matter which number type is used in the \cgal kernel.
  This is achieved by calling `to_double()` on \f$x\f$ or \f$y\f$ coordinate before outputting them.
- A \gnuplot script file named `prefix.plt` to be loaded by \gnuplot to plot the set of vertices and the set of edges.
  The set of vertices is read from the above data file and the set of edges are included in the script file
  with the syntax `set arrow from x1, y1 to x2, y2`.

For details on how to use this function to generate \gnuplot files, please refer to Section \ref sec_CBS_examples.

\section sec_CBS_examples Examples

\subsection CBS_coneboundaries Computing Cone Boundaries Exactly or Inexactly

The following example shows how to compute the directions of the cone boundaries
exactly given the cone number and the initial direction. This example basically consists of the following steps:

1. Define `Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel_with_root_of` as the kernel type
   to compute the cone boundaries exactly.
2. Construct a `Compute_cone_boundaries_2` object named  `cones` with the above kernel
   as the template parameter. Note that since the functor `Compute_cone_boundaries_2` has no
   member variables but member types and functions, its constructor needs no arguments.
3. Initialize a vector of `Direction_2` named `rays` to store the computed results.
4. Use `cones` to compute the cone boundaries by passing the cone number, the initial direction
   and the beginning iterator of `rays` to it.
5. Output the computed results.

\cgalExample{Cone_spanners_2/compute_cones.cpp}

Note that, in this example, for any k<=28, the computation can be done successfully; for any k>28, the computation
cannot be completed because `CORE::Expr`, which we use as the number type for the exact kernel,
exceeds its limit. It seems that k<=28 will suffice for most applications. Also, if inexact computation
is used, the computation will be successful for any k>1, and much quicker than exact computation.
We also note here that we don't experiment with `leda_real`.

As a final note, to compute the cone boundaries inexactly, just define the `Kernel` to be
`Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel` in the above example.

\subsection CBS_construction Constructing Graphs Exactly or Inexactly and Generating Gnuplot Files

The following example shows how to construct Theta graphs exactly and generate \gnuplot files.
This example basically consists of the following steps:
1. Define `Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel_with_root_of` as the kernel type
   to construct the graph exactly.
2. Define the graph type to store the constructed graph.
3. Construct a `Construct_theta_graph_2` object named `theta` with the number of cones and the initial direction
   as constructor arguments.
4. Construct a graph object `g` to store the constructed graph.
5. Use `theta` to construct the Theta graph by passing the input vertices and `g` to it.
6. Generate \gnuplot files for plotting the construct graph.

\cgalExample{Cone_spanners_2/theta_io.cpp}

To construct Theta graphs inexactly, just define the `Kernel` to be
`Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel` in the above example. And the way of
constructing Yao graphs exactly or inexactly is the same as that of constructing
Theta graphs, just replacing the functor `Construct_theta_graph_2` by the functor
`Construct_yao_graph_2`.

Note that, for Theta graph, the `Kernel` defined must support the `CGAL::sqrt()` operation.
This is required by the `bisector()` function, which is used to calculate the angle
bisector of a cone. For instance, the compiler will complain if
`Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel` (not supporting `CGAL::sqrt()`)
is defined as the kernel, but `Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel` will be fine
since it supports `CAL::sqrt()`. For Yao graph, there is no such restriction, since its construction
does not need `CGAL::sqrt()`.

Also note that when using g++ or clang++ compilers with the c++11 standard,
using a directed graph will cause a compilation error due to a
<a href="http://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2016/05/229458.php">bug</a> in the boost library.
As a workaround you can use a undirected graph instead.

After compiling `theta_io.cpp`, execute the executable `theta_io` to construct a Theta graph with 4 cones
on a set of 20 vertices (which is given in the file `data/n20.cin`):

\code{.txt}
      $ ./theta_io  4  data/n20.cin
\endcode

The following two files will be generated for \gnuplot:
- `t4n20.v`:  This file contains the \f$(x, y)\f$-coordinates of the 20 vertices.
- `t4n20.plt`: This is the script to be loaded by \gnuplot. It will read
          `t4n20.v` to plot the vertices. It will also plot all the edges,
          which are included in this script itself.

\cgalFigureRef{f-t4} shows the Theta graph plotted when the above `t4n20.plt` is loaded by \gnuplot.

\cgalFigureBegin{f-t4, t4n20.jpg}

\cgalFigureEnd

\subsection CBS_diff_exact Exact Construction Can Make a Difference

This subsection gives an example vertex set on which the exact construction provided
in this package can produce the correct Theta graph while the inexact construction cannot.

This vertex set, given in the file `examples/data/n9.cin`, consists of 9 vertices
with the following \f$(x, y)\f$-coordinates:
\code{.txt}
0.000000  0.000000
0.000000  1.000000
0.000000  2.000000
1.000000  0.000000
1.000000  1.000000
1.000000  2.000000
2.000000  0.000000
2.000000  1.000000
2.000000  2.000000
\endcode

If we construct the directed Theta graph on this vertex set with \f$k=4\f$ and its cone boundaries
on the \f$x\f$ and \f$y\f$ axis, the exact construction will produce the Theta graph shown in
\cgalFigureRef{f-t4n9exact}. Based on our definition on Theta graph presented in the
Section \ref sec_CBS_mydefinitions, we can verify that the Theta graph in \cgalFigureRef{f-t4n9exact}
is correctly constructed.

\cgalFigureBegin{f-t4n9exact, t4n9exact.jpg}
The correct Theta graph produced by the exact construction.
\cgalFigureEnd

On the other hand, the inexact construction will produce the Theta graph
depicted in \cgalFigureRef{f-t4n9inexact}. We can see that this Theta graph is not constructed
correctly, since the inexact construction will make wrong decisions on whether
those vertices on the cone boundaries belong to a certain cone.

\cgalFigureBegin{f-t4n9inexact, t4n9inexact.jpg}
The incorrect Theta graph produced by the inexact construction.
\cgalFigureEnd

This example demonstrates that the exact construction capability
provided by this package can be very
valuable if it is a strict requirement that graphs be constructed correctly.

\subsection CBS_using_BGL Using BGL Algorithms

The following example, 'dijkstra_theta.cpp', shows how to call algorithms from BGL to do further processing
after the graphs are constructed. Since the constructed Theta or Yao graphs are stored in the class
`boost::adjacency_list`, it is convenient to apply BGL algorithms into the constructed graphs.
Specifically, this example constructs a Theta graph first and then calculates
the shortest paths on this graph by calling the Dijkstra's algorithm from BGL.
It mainly consists of the following steps:

1. Define `Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel` as the kernel type
   to construct the graph inexactly.
2. Define a structure named `Edge_property` for storing the Euclidean length of each edge,
   which is needed by the Dijkstra's algorithm.
3. Define the graph type to store the constructed graph, passing `Edge_property` as a template
   parameter to the graph type `boost::adjacency_list`.
4. Construct a `Construct_theta_graph_2` object named `theta`.
5. Construct a graph object `g` to store the constructed graph.
6. Use `theta` to construct the Theta graph by passing the input vertices and `g` to it.
7. After `g` is constructed, calculate the Euclidean length of each edge in `g`.
8. Calculate the shortest distances from `v0` to other vertices by calling the function
   `dijkstra_shortest_paths()` from BGL.
