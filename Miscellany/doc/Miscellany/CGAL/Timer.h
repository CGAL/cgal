The class `Timer` is a timer class for measuring user process time.

\warning When used to profile a multithreaded algorithm, this timer
will add up the process time of each thread, which may be unexpected.
To compute the wall-clock time of an algorithm, please consider using
`CGAL::Real_timer`.

A timer `t` of type `Timer` is an object with a state. It is
either *running* or it is *stopped*. The state is controlled
with `Timer::start()` and `Timer::stop()`. The timer counts the
time elapsed since its creation or last reset. It counts only the time
where it is in the running state. The time information is given in seconds.
The timer counts also the number of intervals it was running, i.e.\ it
counts the number of calls of the `Timer::start()` member function since the
last reset. If the reset occures while the timer is running it counts as the
first interval.

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

The timer class is based on the C function `std::clock()` on
PC systems and the C function `getrusage()` on standard
POSIX systems. The counter for the `std::clock()` based
solution might wrap around (overflow) after only about 36
minutes. This won't happen on POSIX systems. The system calls to these
timers might fail, in which case a warning message will be issued
through the \cgal error handler and the functions return with the
error codes indicated above. The `Timer::precision()` method computes the
precision dynamically at runtime at its first invocation.
