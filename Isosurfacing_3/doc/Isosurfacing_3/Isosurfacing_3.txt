\section SecIsoSurfacingIntroduction Introduction

Given a scalar field, an isosurface is defined as the locus of points where the scalar field
has a given constant value; in other words, it is a level set.
This constant value is referred to as "isovalue", and, for well-behaved scalar fields,
the level set forms a surface.
"Isosurfacing", also known as "isosurface extraction" or "contouring", is the process of constructing
the isosurface corresponding to a given scalar field and isovalue.
This process is often needed for volume visualization and the simulation of physical phenomena.

This \cgal package provides methods to extract isosurfaces from 3D scalar fields.
These contouring techniques rely on the discretization of the 3D space to construct
an approximate representation of the isosurface.
The 3D scalar field can be described through various representations: an implicit function,
an interpolated set of discrete sampling values, etc. (see \ref SecIsosurfacingExamples). The isovalue is user-defined.
The output is a polygon soup, made either of triangles or quads depending on the method,
and can be a single connected component, or made of multiple, disjoint components.
Note that due to the inherent approximate nature of these discrete methods, parts of the "true"
isosurface may be missing from the output, and the output may contain artifacts that are not present
in the true isosurface.

\section SecIsosurfacingMethods Isosurfacing Methods

The scientific literature abounds with algorithms for extracting isosurfaces, each coming
with different properties for the output and requirements for the input \cgalCite{cgal:dljjaw-sisp-15}.
This package offers the following methods
<ul>
 <li>Marching Cubes \cgalCite{LC87}</li>: a simple and efficient method that generates a triangle mesh, with almost no guarantees.
 <li>Topologically Correct Marching Cubes \cgalCite{cgal:g-ctcmi-16}</li>: an extension to Marching Cubes that provides additional guarantees for the output.
 <li>%Dual Contouring \cgalCite{cgal:jlsw-dchd-02}</li>: a method that generates a polygon mesh, with focus on sharp features recovery.
</ul>

\subsection SubSecMarchingCubes Marching Cubes (MC)

Marching Cubes (MC) uses a volumetric grid, i.e., a 3D iso-cuboid partitioned into hexahedral cells.
All cells of the grid are processed individually using values of the scalar field at the grid corners.
Each cell corner is assigned a sign (+/-) to indicate whether its scalar field value is above
or below the user-defined isovalue.
A vertex is created for each grid edge with a sign change, i.e., where the edge intersects the isosurface.
More specifically, the vertex position is computed via linear interpolation of
the scalar field values evaluated at the cell corners forming the edge.
These vertices are connected to form triangles within the cell, depending on the configuration
of signs at the cell corners. Figure \ref Fig_IsosurfacingMCCases illustrates the configurations in 2D.
In 3D, there is no less than 33 cases (not shown) \cgalCite{cgal:c-mcctci-95}.

The implementation within \cgal is generic in the sense that it can process any grid-like data structure
that consists of hexahedral cells.
In case of a conforming [not defined] grid, the Marching Cubes algorithm generates
as output a surface triangle mesh that is 2-manifold in most scenarios.
[@todo PA: reformulate, as it is either strict or not - precise in which cases it is not, and say
whether you talk about just combinatorially 2-manifold, or truly 2-manifold with 3D embedding taken into account]
If the mesh is 2-manifold and the isosurface does not intersect the domain boundary, then the output mesh is watertight.
As the Marching Cubes algorithm uses linear interpolation of the sampled scalar field along the grid edges,
it can miss details or components that are not captured by the sampling of the scalar field.

Compared to other approaches such as Delaunay refinement, and depending on the parameters,
MC often generates more triangles, and more skinny triangles with small or large angles.
@todo PA: The statement is too strong - I would largely reformulate it as this depends too much on the parameters. I recommend to add instead a figure with different parameters and methods,
depicting the mesh edges in black in addition to the shaded facets.

MC does not preserve the sharp features present in the isovalue of the input scalar field
(see Figure \ref Fig_IsosurfacingMCDC).

\subsection SubSecTMC Topologically Correct Marching Cubes (TMC)

Topologically Correct Marching Cubes is an extension to the Marching Cubes algorithm
which provides additional guarantees for the output \cgalCite{cgal:g-ctcmi-16}.
It generates as output a mesh that is homeomorphic to the trilinear interpolant of the input scalar
field inside each cube. This means that the output mesh can accurately represent small complex features.
For example, a tunnel of the isosurface within a single cell is topologically resolved.
To achieve this, the algorithm can insert additional vertices within cells.
Furthermore, the mesh is guaranteed to be 2-manifold and watertight, as long as the isosurface
does not intersect the domain boundaries. [and the input is 2-manifold?]

\subsection SubSecDualContouring Dual Contouring (DC)

%Dual Contouring (DC) is a method that does not generate vertices on the grid edges, but within cells.
Next, a face is created for each edge that intersects the isosurface by connecting the vertices
of the incident cells. For a uniform hexahedral grid, this results into a quadrilateral surface mesh.
%Dual Contouring can deal with any domain but guarantees neither a 2-manifold nor a watertight mesh.
On the other hand it generates fewer faces and high quality faces than Marching Cubes, in general.
Finally, its main advantage over Marching Cubes is its ability to recover sharp creases and corners.

\cgalFigureCaptionBegin{Fig_IsosurfacingMCDC}

\cgalFigureCaptionEnd

In addition to the scalar field, %Dual Contouring requires knowledge of the gradient of said scalar field.

The \cgal implementation uses a point positioning strategy based on Quadric Error Metrics: for
a cell, the position of the vertex is computed by minimizing the error to the sum of the quadrics
defined at each edge-isosurface intersection.
Using this strategy, the position can in fact lie outside the cell, which is a desirable property
to improve the odds of recovering sharp features, but it might also create self-intersections.
Users can choose to constrain the placement to lie within the cell.

By default, %Dual Contouring creates quads, but using edge-isosurface intersections,
one can "star" these quads to create four triangles. This is the default behavior in \cgal,
and it can be changed in the named parameters.

\subsection SubSecIsosurfacingComparison Comparisons

The following table summarizes the differences between the algorithms in terms of constraints
over the input 3D domain, the facets of the output surface mesh, and the properties
of the output surface mesh.

Note that the output mesh has boundaries when the isosurface intersects the domain boundaries,
regardless of the method (see Figure \ref Fig_IsosurfacingOpen).

\section SecInterface Interface

The following functions are the main entry points to the isosurfacing algorithms:
<ul>
 <li>Marching Cubes</li>: `CGAL::Isosurfacing::marching_cubes()`, using the named parameter: `use_topologically_correct_marching_cubes()` set to false;
 <li>Topologically Correct Marching Cubes</li>: `CGAL::Isosurfacing::marching_cubes()`;
 <li>%Dual Contouring</li>: `CGAL::Isosurfacing::dual_contouring()`.
</ul>

These free functions share the same signature:

\code{.cpp}
template <typename ConcurrencyTag = Sequential_tag,
          typename Domain,
          typename PointRange,
          typename PolygonRange>
void ...(const Domain& domain,
         const typename Domain::FT isovalue,
         PointRange& points,
         PolygonRange& polygons);
\endcode

The input (space partition, scalar field, gradient field) is provided in the form of a `domain`,
see \ref SubSecIsosurfacingDomains for a complete description.

The `isovalue` scalar parameter is the value used that defines the isosurface being approximated.

The output discrete surface is provided in the form of a polygon soup, which is stored into
two containers: `points` and `polygons`. Depending on the algorithm, the polygon soup may
store either unorganized polygons with no relationship to one another (no connectivity between them)
or polygons sharing points (the same point is adjacent polygon will be the same point in the point range).

The isosurfacing algorithms can run either sequentially in one thread or in parallel (multithread).
The template parameter `ConcurrencyTag` is used to specify how the algorithm is executed.
To enable parallelism, \cgal must be linked with the <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB">Intel TBB library</a> (see the CMakeLists.txt files in the examples folder).

\subsection SubSecIsosurfacingDomains Domains

A domain is an object that provides functions to access the partition of the 3D volume,
the scalar field, and - optionally - the gradient field at a given position.
These requirements are described through two concepts: `IsosurfacingDomain_3` and `IsosurfacingDomainWithGradient_3`.

Two domains, `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Marching_cubes_domain_3` and `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Dual_contouring_domain_3`,
are provided as the respective default class models that fulfill the requirements of the concepts.
Both these domain models possess template parameters to allow the user to customize the domain:
- <b>Partition:</b> this must be a class that describes the partition of the 3D volume into cells.
                    The most basic example of such class is `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Cartesian_grid_3`, but users
                    can provide their own partition, provided it meets the requirements described
                    by the concept `IsosurfacingPartition_3`.
- <b>ValueField:</b> this must be a class that provides the scalar field at the vertices of the partition.
                      A few classes are provided by default, such as `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Value_function_3` and
                      `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Interpolated_discrete_values_3`. Users can provide their own value class,
                      provided it meets the requirements described by the concept `IsosurfacingValueField_3`.
- <b>GradientField (`Dual_contouring_domain_3` only):</b> this must be a class that provides the gradient
                                                          of the scalar field at the vertices of the partition.
                                                          A few classes are provided by default, such as
                                                          `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Finite_difference_gradient_3` and
                                                          `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Interpolated_discrete_gradients_3`.
                                                          Users can provide their own gradient class,
                                                          provided it meets the requirements described
                                                          by the concept `IsosurfacingGradientField_3`.
- <b>EdgeIntersectionOracle:</b> this must be a class that provides a function to compute the intersection
                                 between an edge and the isosurface. The default is linear interpolation
                                 for `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Marching_cubes_domain_3`, and a dichotomy
                                 for `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Dual_contouring_domain_3`. This parameter should
                                 be adjusted depending on how your value field is defined: there is for
                                 example no point doing a dichotomy in DC if the value field is defined
                                 through linear interpolation. Users can provide their own edge intersection
                                 oracle, provided it meets the requirements described by the concept
                                 `IsosurfacingEdgeIntersectionOracle_3`.

\section SecIsosurfacingExamples Examples

The first two examples are very basic examples for Marching Cubes and %Dual Contouring.
Afterwards, the focus is shifted from the method to the type of input data, and examples
run both methods on different types of input data.

\subsection SubSecMCExample Marching Cubes

The following example illustrates a basic run of the Marching Cubes algorithm, and in particular
the free function to create a domain from a %Cartesian grid, and the named parameter
that enable the user to switch beetween Marching Cubes and Topologically Correct Marching Cubes.

\subsection SubSecDCExample Dual Contouring

The following example illustrates a basic run of the %Dual Contouring algorithm, and in particular
the free function to create a domain from a %Cartesian grid, and the named parameters
that enable triangulating (or not) the output, and to constrain the vertex placement within the cell.

\subsection SubSecImplicitDataExample Implicit Data

The following example shows the usage of Marching Cubes and %Dual Contouring algorithms to extract
an isosurface. The domain is an implicit domain that describes the unit sphere
by the distance to its center (set to the origin) as an implicit field.

\subsection SubSecDiscreteDataExample Discrete Data

In the following example, the input data is sampled at the vertices of a grid, and interpolated.

\subsection SubSecImageDataExample 3D Image

The following example shows how to load data from an `Image_3`, and generate an isosurface
from this voxel data.

\subsection SubSecOffsetDataExample Offset Mesh

The following example illustrates how to generates a mesh approximating a signed offset to an input
closed surface mesh. The input mesh is stored into an `AABB_tree` data structure to provide fast
distance queries. Via the `Side_of_triangle_mesh` functor, the sign of the distance field is made
negative inside the mesh.

\section SecIsosurfacingHistory Design and Implementation History

The development of this package started during the 2022 Google Summer of Code, with the contribution
of Julian Stahl, mentored by Daniel Zint and Pierre Alliez, providing a first implementation
of Marching Cubes, Topologically Correct Marching Cubes, and %Dual Contouring. Marching Cubes tables
were provided by Roberto Grosso (FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg). Mael Rouxel-Labbé worked on improving
the initial %Dual Contouring implementation, and on the first version of the package.
