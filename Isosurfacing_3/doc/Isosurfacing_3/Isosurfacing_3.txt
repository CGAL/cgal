\section SecIsoSurfacingIntroduction Introduction

Given a field of a scalar values, an isosurface is defined as the locus of points where the field
has a given constant value; in other words, it is a level set.
This constant value is referred to as the "isovalue", and, for well-behaved fields,
the level set forms a surface.
In the following, we shall refer to the the field of scalar values as the value field.
"Isosurfacing", also known as "isosurface extraction" or "contouring", is the process of constructing
the isosurface corresponding to a given value field and isovalue.
Isosurfacing is often needed for volume visualization and for the simulation of physical phenomena.

This \cgal package provides methods to extract isosurfaces from 3D value fields.
These contouring techniques rely on the partition of the 3D space and of the field to construct
an approximate representation of the isosurface.
The 3D value field can be described through various representations: an implicit function,
an interpolated set of discrete sampling values, etc. (see \ref SecIsosurfacingExamples).
The isovalue is user-defined.
The output is a polygon soup, made either of triangles or quads depending on the method,
and may consist of a single connected component, or multiple, disjoint components.
Note that due to the inherent approximate nature of these discrete methods that only sample 3D value fields,
parts of the "true" isosurface may be missing from the output, and the output may contain artifacts
that re not present in the true isosurface.

\section SecIsosurfacingMethods Isosurfacing Methods

The scientific literature abounds with algorithms for extracting isosurfaces, each coming
with different properties for the output and requirements for the input \cgalCite{cgal:dljjaw-sisp-15}.
This package offers the following methods

<ul>
 <li>\ref SubSecMarchingCubes : a simple and efficient method that generates a triangle mesh, with almost no guarantees.</li>
 <li>\ref SubSecTMC : an extension to Marching Cubes that provides additional guarantees for the output.</li>
 <li>\ref SubSecDualContouring : a method that generates a polygon mesh, with a focus on sharp features recovery.</li>
</ul>

\subsection SubSecMarchingCubes Marching Cubes (MC)

Marching Cubes (MC) \cgalCite{LC87} uses a volumetric grid, i.e., a 3D iso-cuboid partitioned into hexahedral cells.
All cells of the grid are processed individually using values of the value field sampled at the grid corners.
Each cell corner is assigned a sign (+/-) to indicate whether its value field value is above
or below the user-defined isovalue.
A vertex is created along each grid edge where a sign change occurs, i.e., where the edge intersects the isosurface.
More specifically, the vertex location is computed via linear interpolation of
the value field values evaluated at the cell corners forming the edge.
These vertices are connected to form triangles within the cell, depending on the configuration
of signs at the cell corners. \cgalFigureRef{IsosurfacingMCCases} illustrates the configurations in 2D.
In 3D, there are no less than 33 configurations (not shown) \cgalCite{cgal:c-mcctci-95}.

The implementation within \cgal is generic in the sense that it can process any grid-like data structure
that consists of hexahedral cells. When the hexahedral grid is a conforming grid (meaning that the
intersection of two hexahedral cells is a face, an edge, or a vertex), the Marching Cubes algorithm
generates as output a surface triangle mesh that is almost always combinatorially 2-manifold,
yet can still exhibit topological issues such as holes or non-conforming edges.

If the mesh is 2-manifold and the isosurface does not intersect the domain boundary,
then the output mesh is watertight. As the Marching Cubes algorithm uses linear interpolation
of the sampled value field along the grid edges, it can miss details or components
that are not captured by the sampling of the value field.

Compared to other meshing approaches such as Delaunay refinement, Marching Cubes is substantially faster,
but often tends to generate more triangle facets for an equivalent desired sizing field.
In addition, the quality of the triangle facets is in general poor, with many needle/cap shaped triangles.

Furthermore, Marching Cubes does not preserve the sharp features present in the isovalue of the input value field (see \cgalFigureRef{IsosurfacingMCDC}).

\subsection SubSecTMC Topologically Correct Marching Cubes (TMC)

Topologically Correct Marching Cubes is an extension to the Marching Cubes algorithm
which provides additional guarantees for the output \cgalCite{cgal:g-ctcmi-16}.
More specifically, it generates as output a mesh that is homeomorphic to the trilinear interpolant of the input value field inside each cube. This means that the output mesh can accurately represent small complex features.
For example, a tunnel of the isosurface within a single cell is topologically resolved.
To achieve this, the algorithm can insert additional vertices within cells.
Furthermore, the mesh is guaranteed to be 2-manifold and watertight, as long as the isosurface
does not intersect the domain boundaries.

\subsection SubSecDualContouring Dual Contouring (DC)

%Dual Contouring (DC) \cgalCite{cgal:jlsw-dchd-02} is a method that does not generate vertices
on the grid edges, but within cells instead. A facet is created for each edge that intersects the isosurface
by connecting the vertices of the incident cells. For a uniform hexahedral grid, this results
in a quadrilateral surface mesh. %Dual Contouring can deal with any domain but guarantees
neither a 2-manifold nor a watertight mesh. On the other hand, it generates fewer faces
and higher quality faces than Marching Cubes, in general. Finally, its main advantage over Marching Cubes
is its ability to recover sharp creases and corners.

\cgalFigureCaptionBegin{IsosurfacingMCDC}

\cgalFigureCaptionEnd

In addition to the 3D value field, %Dual Contouring requires knowledge about the gradient of the value field.

The \cgal implementation uses a vertex positioning strategy based on *Quadric Error Metrics*: for
a cell, the vertex location is computed by minimizing the error to the sum of the quadrics
defined at each edge-isosurface intersection.
Using this approach, the vertex may be located outside the cell, which is a desirable property
to improve the odds of recovering sharp features, but it might also create self-intersections.
Users can choose to constrain the vertex location inside the cell.

By default, %Dual Contouring generates quads, but using edge-isosurface intersections,
one can "star" these quads to generate four triangles. Triangulating the quads is the default behavior in \cgal,
but this can be changed via named parameters.

\subsection SubSecIsosurfacingComparison Comparisons

The following table summarizes the differences between the algorithms in terms of constraints
over the input 3D domain, the facets of the output surface mesh, and the properties
of the output surface mesh.

| ----              | ----        | ----       | ----          | ----                  | ----                       |
  MC                | Triangles   | no         | no            | no                    | no                         |
  TMC               | Triangles   | yes        | yes           | yes                   | no                         |

</center>

(* assuming the isosurface does not exit the specified bounding box of the input 3D domain)

Note that the output mesh has boundaries when the isosurface intersects the domain boundaries,
regardless of the method (see \cgalFigureRef{IsosurfacingOpen}).

\section SecInterface Interface

The following functions are the main entry points to the isosurfacing algorithms:
<ul>
 <li>Marching Cubes</li>: `CGAL::Isosurfacing::marching_cubes()`, using the named parameter:`use_topologically_correct_marching_cubes` set to `false`;
 <li>Topologically Correct Marching Cubes</li>: `CGAL::Isosurfacing::marching_cubes()`;
 <li>%Dual Contouring</li>: `CGAL::Isosurfacing::dual_contouring()`.
</ul>

These three free functions share the same signature:

\code{.cpp}
template <typename ConcurrencyTag = CGAL::Sequential_tag,
          typename Domain,
          typename PointRange,
          typename PolygonRange>
void ...(const Domain& domain,
         const typename Domain::FT isovalue,
         PointRange& points,
         PolygonRange& polygons);
\endcode

The input (space partition, value field, gradient field) is provided in the form of a `domain`,
see \ref SubSecIsosurfacingDomains for a complete description.

The `isovalue` scalar parameter is the value that defines the isosurface being approximated.

The output discrete surface is provided in the form of a polygon soup, which is stored into
two containers: `points` and `polygons`. Depending on the algorithm, the polygon soup may
store either unorganized polygons with no relationship to one another (ie, no connectivity is shared between them)
or polygons sharing points (the same point in adjacent polygons will be the same point in the point range).

The isosurfacing algorithms can run either sequentially in one thread or in parallel via multithreading.
The template parameter `ConcurrencyTag` is used to specify how the algorithm is executed.
To enable parallelism, \cgal must be linked with the <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB">Intel TBB library</a> (see the CMakeLists.txt file in the examples folder).

\subsection SubSecIsosurfacingDomains Domains

A domain is an object that provides functions to access the partition of the 3D volume,
the value field, and, optionally, the gradient field at a given point query.
These requirements are described through two concepts: `IsosurfacingDomain_3` and `IsosurfacingDomainWithGradient_3`.

Two domains, `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Marching_cubes_domain_3` and `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Dual_contouring_domain_3`,
are provided as the respective default class models that fulfill the requirements of the concepts.
Both these domain models have template parameters enabling the user to customize the domain:
- <b>Partition:</b> this must be a class that describes the partition of the 3D volume into cells.
                    The most basic example of such a class is `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Cartesian_grid_3`, but users
                    can pass their own partition, provided it meets the requirements described
                    by the concept `IsosurfacingPartition_3`.
- <b>ValueField:</b> this must be a class that provides the 3D value field at the vertices of the partition.
                     A few classes are provided, such as `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Value_function_3` and
                     `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Interpolated_discrete_values_3`. Users can pass their own value class,
                     provided it meets the requirements described by the concept `IsosurfacingValueField_3`.
- <b>GradientField:</b> (`CGAL::Isosurfacing::Dual_contouring_domain_3` only) this must be a class that provides the gradient
                                                                              of the value field at the vertices of the partition.
                                                                              A few classes are provided by default, such as
                                                                              `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Finite_difference_gradient_3` and
                                                                              `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Interpolated_discrete_gradients_3`.
                                                                              Users can pass their own gradient class,
                                                                              provided it meets the requirements described
                                                                              by the concept `IsosurfacingGradientField_3`.
- <b>EdgeIntersectionOracle:</b> this must be a class that provides a function to compute the intersection
                                 between an edge and the isosurface. The default is linear interpolation
                                 for `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Marching_cubes_domain_3`, and a dichotomy
                                 for `CGAL::Isosurfacing::Dual_contouring_domain_3`. This parameter should
                                 be adjusted depending on how the value field is defined: there is for
                                 example no point incorporating a dichotomy in Dual Contouring if the value field is defined
                                 through linear interpolation. Users can pass their own edge intersection
                                 oracle, provided it meets the requirements described by the concept
                                 `IsosurfacingEdgeIntersectionOracle_3`.

\section SecIsosurfacingExamples Examples

The first two examples are very basic examples for Marching Cubes and %Dual Contouring.
Afterwards, the focus is shifted from the method to the type of input data, and examples
run both methods on different types of input data.

The following example illustrates how to generate a mesh approximating a signed offset to an input
closed surface mesh. The input mesh is stored into an `AABB_tree` data structure to provide fast
distance queries. Via the `Side_of_triangle_mesh` functor, the sign of the distance field is made
negative inside the mesh.

\cgalExample{Isosurfacing_3/contouring_mesh_offset.cpp}

\section SecIsosurfacingHistory Design and Implementation History

The development of this package started during the 2022 Google Summer of Code, with the contribution
of Julian Stahl, mentored by Daniel Zint and Pierre Alliez, providing a first implementation
of Marching Cubes, Topologically Correct Marching Cubes, and %Dual Contouring. Marching Cubes tables
were provided by Roberto Grosso (FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg). Mael Rouxel-Labbé worked on improving
the initial %Dual Contouring implementation, and on the first complete version of the package.
