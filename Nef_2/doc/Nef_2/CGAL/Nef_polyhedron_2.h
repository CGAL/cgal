An instance of data type `Nef_polyhedron_2<T>` is a subset of the
plane that is the result of forming complements and intersections
starting from a finite set `H` of
halfspaces. `Nef_polyhedron_2` is closed under all binary set
operations `intersection`, `union`, `difference`,
`complement` and under the topological operations `boundary`,
`closure`, and `interior`.

The template parameter `T` is specified via an extended kernel
concept. `T` must be a model of the concept
`ExtendedKernelTraits_2`.

\cgalHeading{Exploration - Point location - Ray shooting}

As Nef polyhedra are the result of forming complements
and intersections starting from a set `H` of halfspaces that are
defined by oriented lines in the plane, they can be represented by
an attributed plane map \f$ M = (V,E,F)\f$. For topological queries
within `M` the following types and operations allow exploration
access to this structure.

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

Nef polyhedra are implemented on top of a halfedge data structure and
use linear space in the number of vertices, edges and facets.
Operations like `empty` take constant time. The operations
`clear`, `complement`, `interior`, `closure`,
`boundary`, `regularization`, input and output take linear
time. All binary set operations and comparison operations take time
\f$ O(n \log n)\f$ where \f$ n\f$ is the size of the output plus the size of the
input.

The point location and ray shooting operations are implemented in two
flavors. The `NAIVE` operations run in linear query time without
any preprocessing, the `DEFAULT` operations (equals `LMWT`)
run in sub-linear query time, but preprocessing is triggered with the
first operation. Preprocessing takes time \f$ O(N^2)\f$, the sub-linear
point location time is either logarithmic when LEDA's persistent
dictionaries are present or if not then the point location time is
worst-case linear, but experiments show often sublinear runtimes. Ray
shooting equals point location plus a walk in the constrained
triangulation overlayed on the plane map representation. The cost of
the walk is proportional to the number of triangles passed in
direction `d` until an obstacle is met. In a minimum weight
triangulation of the obstacles (the plane map representing the
polyhedron) the theory provides a \f$ O(\sqrt{n})\f$ bound for the number
of steps. Our locally minimum weight triangulation approximates the
minimum weight triangulation only heuristically (the calculation of
the minimum weight triangulation is conjectured to be NP hard). Thus
we have no runtime guarantee but a strong experimental motivation for
its approximation.

\cgalHeading{Example}

Nef polyhedra are parameterized by a so-called extended geometric
kernel. There are three kernels, one based on a homogeneous
representation of extended points called
`Extended_homogeneous<RT>` where `RT` is a ring type providing
additionally a `gcd` operation, one based on a %Cartesian
representation of extended points called `Extended_cartesian<NT>`
where `NT` is a field type, and finally
`Filtered_extended_homogeneous<RT>` (an optimized version of the
first). The following example uses the filtered homogeneous kernel to
construct the intersection of two halfspaces.

\cgalExample{Nef_2/nef_2_intersection.cpp}

After line (*) `N3` is the intersection of `N1` and `N2`.
The member types of `Nef_polyhedron_2< Extended_homogeneous<NT> >`
map to corresponding types of the standard \cgal geometry kernel
(type equality in pseudo-code notation):

\code{.cpp}
CGAL::Nef_polyhedron_2< CGAL::Extended_cartesian< FT > >::Point == CGAL::Cartesian<FT>::Point_2

CGAL::Nef_polyhedron_2< CGAL::Extended_homogeneous< RT > >::Point == CGAL::Homogeneous< RT >::Point_2

CGAL::Nef_polyhedron_2< CGAL::Filtered_extended_homogeneous<RT> >::Point == CGAL::Homogeneous<RT>::Point_2
\endcode

The same holds for the types `Line` and `Direction` in the
local scope of `Nef_polyhedron_2<...>`.

An instance `D` of the data type `Topological_explorer` is a
decorator for interfacing the topological structure of a plane map
`P` (read-only).

A plane map `P` consists of a triple \f$ (V, E, F)\f$ of vertices,
edges, and faces. We collectively call them objects. An edge `e`
is a pair of vertices `(v,w)` with incidence operations `v = source(e)`, `w = target(e)`. The list of all edges with source
`v` is called the adjacency list `A(v)`.

Edges are paired into twins. For each edge `e = (v,w)` there's an
edge `twin(e) = (w,v)` and `twin(twin(e)) == e`\cgalFootnote{The existence of the edge pairs makes  \cgalFootnoteCode{P} a bidirected graph, the  \cgalFootnoteCode{twin} links make  \cgalFootnoteCode{P} a map.}.

An edge `e = (v,w)` knows two adjacent edges `en = next(e)`
and `ep = previous(e)` where `source(en) = w`,
`previous(en) = e` and `target(ep) = v` and `next(ep) = e`. By this symmetric `previous-next` relationship all edges are
partitioned into face cycles. Two edges \f$ e\f$ and \f$ e'\f$ are in the same
face cycle if \f$ e = next^*(e')\f$. All edges `e` in the same
face cycle have the same incident face \f$ f = face(e)\f$. The cyclic
order on the adjacency list of a vertex `v = source(e)` is given
by `cyclic_adj_succ(e) = twin(previous(e))` and
`cyclic_adj_pred(e) = next(twin(e))`.

A vertex `v` is embedded via coordinates `point(v)`. By the
embedding of its source and target an edge corresponds to a
segment. `P` has the property that the embedding is always
<I>order-preserving</I>. This means a ray fixed in `point(v)` of
a vertex `v` and swept around counterclockwise meets the
embeddings of `target(e)` (\f$ e \in A(v)\f$) in the cyclic order
defined by the list order of `A`.

The embedded face cycles partition the plane into maximal connected
subsets of points. Each such set corresponds to a face. A face is
bounded by its incident face cycles. For all the edges in the
non-trivial face cycles it holds that the face is left of the edges.
There can also be trivial face cycles in form of isolated vertices in
the interior of a face. Each such vertex `v` knows its surrounding
face `f = face(v)`.

Plane maps are attributed, for each object \f$ u \in V \cup E \cup F\f$ we
attribute an information `mark(u)` of type `Mark`. `Mark`
fits the concepts assignable, default-constructible, and
equal-comparable.

a decorator to examine the underlying plane map.

An instance `E` of the data type `Explorer` is a decorator to
explore the structure of the plane map underlying the Nef
polyhedron. It inherits all topological adjacency exploration
operations from `Topological_explorer`. `Explorer`
additionally allows one to explore the geometric embedding.

The position of each vertex is given by a so-called extended point,
which is either a standard affine point or the tip of a ray touching
an infinimaximal square frame centered at the origin. A vertex `v`
is called a <I>standard</I> vertex if its embedding is a
<I>standard</I> point and <I>non-standard</I> if its embedding is a
<I>non-standard</I> point. By the straightline embedding of their
source and target vertices, edges correspond to either affine
segments, rays or lines or are part of the bounding frame.
