Snap Rounding (SR, for short) is a well known method for converting
arbitrary-precision arrangements of segments into a fixed-precision
representation [Good,Guib,Hobb]. In the study of robust geometric
computing, it can be classified as a finite precision approximation
technique. Iterated Snap Rounding (ISR, for short) is a modification
of SR in which each vertex is at least half-the-width-of-a-pixel away
from any non-incident edge [Halp]. This package supports both
methods. Algorithmic details and experimental results are given in [Halp].
