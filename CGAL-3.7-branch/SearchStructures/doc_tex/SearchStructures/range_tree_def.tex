A one-dimensional range tree is a binary search tree on one-dimensional 
point data. 
The point data of the tree is stored in the leaves. 
Each inner vertex stores the highest entry of its left subtree.
The version of a range tree implemented here is static, which means that 
after construction of the tree, no elements be inserted or deleted.
A $d$-dimensional range tree is a binary leaf search tree according to the 
first dimension of the $d$-dimensional point data, where each vertex contains 
a $(d-1)$-dimensional search tree of the points in the subtree (sublayer tree)
with respect to the second dimension.
See~\cite{bkos-cgaa-97} and~\cite{s-dasds-90} for more detailed information.

A $d$-dimensional range tree can be used to determine all
$d$-dimensional points that lie inside  a given $d$-dimensional
interval (\ccStyle{window\_query}).

%The tree can be built in  ${\cal O}(n\log^{d-1} n)$ time and
%needs  ${\cal O}(n\log^{d-1} n)$ space. The $d$-dimensional points that lie in the
%$d$-dimensional query interval can be reported in ${\cal O}(\log^dn+k)$ time,
%where $n$ is the total number of points and $k$ is the number of
%reported points.
