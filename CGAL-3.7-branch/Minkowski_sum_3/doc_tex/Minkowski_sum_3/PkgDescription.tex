\ccPkgSummary{
This package provides a function, which computes the Minkowski sum of
two point sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$. These point sets may consist of
isolated vertices, isolated edges, surfaces with convex facets without
holes, and open and closed solids. Thus, it is possible to compute
the configuration space of translational robots (even in tight passage
scenarios) as well as several graphics operations, like for instance
the glide operation, which computes the point set swept by a
polyhedron that moves along a polygonal line.
