The Mesh_3  package  generates 3 dimensional 
isotropic simplicial meshes. The discretized region
may be a monodomain, i.e. a single connected component,
 or  a multidomain subdivided
into different subdomains.
The domain is input as an oracle able to answer
 queries, of a few different types, on the domain.
In the current version, Mesh_3 generate meshes for domain described
through implicit functions,  3D images or polyhedral boundaries.
The output is a 3D mesh of the domain volume
and conformal surface meshes for all the boundary and subdividing
surfaces.
