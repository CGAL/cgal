\ccDefinition

The concept \ccRefName\ describes the requirements for the vertex type of the
\ccc{StraightSkeleton_2} concept. It is a refinement of the \ccc{HalfedgeDSVertex} concept
with support for storage of the incident halfedge. The \ccRefName\ concept requires the geometric embedding to be a 2D point.

\ccAccessFunctions
  \ccMethod{int id() const;}{The ID of the vertex.}

  \ccMethod{Halfedge_handle primary_bisector();}{}
  \ccGlue
  \ccMethod{Halfedge_const_handle primary_bisector() const;}
{Returns the skeleton halfedge incident upon the vertex (called the \textit{primary} bisector).}
  \ccGlue
  \ccMethod{Halfedge_around_vertex_circulator halfedge_around_vertex_begin();}{}
  \ccGlue
  \ccMethod{Halfedge_around_vertex_const_circulator halfedge_around_vertex_begin() const;}
{Returns a bi-directional circulator pointing to one of the incident halfedges (which one is unspecified).\\
There will always be as many incident halfedges as the degree of the vertex.\\
If this is a \textit{contour} vertex, its degree is exactly 3, and from the halfedges pointed to by the circulator, 2 are contour and 1 is a bisector.\\
If this is an \ccc{skeleton} vertex, its degree is at least 3 and all of the halfedges pointed to by the circulator are bisectors.\\
Each halfedge pointed to by this circulator is the one which is oriented towards the vertex (according to the geometric embedding).}

  \ccGlue
  \ccMethod{Defining_contour_halfedge_const_circulator defining_contour_halfedges_begin() const;}
{Returns a bi-directional circulator pointing to one of the defining contour halfedges of the vertex (which one is unspecified).\\
There will always be as many incident defining contour halfedges as the degree of the vertex.\\
Each halfedge pointed to by this circulator is the one having its left side facing inwards (which happens to be the contour halfedge for which \ccc{is\_border()} is \ccc{false}).}
