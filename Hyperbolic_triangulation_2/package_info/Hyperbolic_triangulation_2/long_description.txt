The package 2D Hyperbolic Triangulation provides Delaunay triangulations
in the Poincaré disk model of the hyperbolic plane, complete with demos,
examples, and tests. The hyperbolic Delaunay triangulation defined by a
set of points in the Poincaré disk model is a simplicial sub-complex of
the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation defined by the same set of points in
the unit disk centered at the origin of the Euclidean plane. More information

        Delaunay complexes and Voronoi diagrams made practical. Journal of
        Computational Geometry, 5(1):56–85, 2014.
