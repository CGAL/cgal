add operator == for triangulations (?)

** traits bisectors

class Construct_hyperbolic_bisector_2
Hyperbolic_segment_2 operator()(Point_2 p, Point_2 q, Point_2 r)
at the end
the following lines are giving the wrong arc (wrong orientation), aren't they?
      CGAL_triangulation_assertion(assign(pair,inters[1]));
      if ( Orientation_2()(approx_c,approx_a,approx_pinf) == POSITIVE )
	return Circular_arc_2( *c_pq, pair.first, a);
      return Circular_arc_2( *c_pq, a, pair.first);
but this is what works on the demo...
understand why

remove variant for supporting circle or line of bisector
call it only when we know that it is a circle
it will simplyfy the code of Construct_hyperbolic_bisector_2 at least in some cases

test bisectors dual functions in special cases of euclidean line segments

** Hyperbolic_random_points_in_disc

see with Olivier: small feature to add new object generator?


========== demo

--- fix bugs:
- conflict regions (when inserting or in mode 'show conflict zone)
show Euclidean triangles instead of hyperbolic triangles  
 
- However, we could think to add a specific mode allowing to show
triangles that are not hyperbolic. Not sure whether this is interesting. 

--- PainterOstream
Is it clean for CGAL to have a local file?

I have to ask Laurent to make some members of PainterOstream protected.
It allows me to have a local file with partial specialization of 
the class PainterOstream.
I have to discuss with Laurent.

========== future

--- make Constrained_delaunay_... work with Hyperbolic_triangulation_2
--- make Mesh_2 work with Hyperbolic_triangulation_2
O.Faugeras and his student are waiting for it.
