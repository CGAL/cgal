\cgalPkgDesc{This package enables building and handling Delaunay triangulations of point sets
in the Poincar&eacute; disk model of the hyperbolic plane. Triangulations are built incrementally and can be modified by insertion
and removal of vertices; point location facilities are also offered, as well as primitives to
build the dual Voronoi diagrams.}

\cgalPkgDescriptionEnd

The Delaunay triangulation of a set of points \f$P\f$ in the hyperbolic plane \f$\mathbb H^2\f$ is a two-dimensional connected simplicial complex with vertex set defined by the points \f$P\f$.

\cgalCRPSection{Concepts}

- `HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2` describes the requirements for an interface for geometric objects, constructions, and predicates in the hyperbolic plane.
- `HyperbolicTriangulationFaceBase_2` describes the requirements for faces of the hyperbolic Delaunay triangulation.
- `HyperbolicFaceData` describes the requirements for an hyperbolic marker of faces of the hyperbolic Delaunay triangulation, used to filter faces of the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation.

\cgalCRPSection{Classes}

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_2` is the main class of the 2D Hyperbolic Triangulation package. It enables the constructions of Delaunay triangulations in the hyperbolic plane. It offers all the functionalities provided by `CGAL::Delaunay_triangulation_2`, such as point location, insertion, and removal. Construction of the dual Voronoi diagram is also provided.
- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_triangulation_face_base_2`

Two models for the concept `HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2` are provided:
- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_traits_2` is by default based upon `CGAL::Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel_with_sqrt` and guarantees exact constructions of Delaunay triangulations and dual objects for input points with algebraic coordinates.
- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_CK_traits_2` is based upon `CGAL::Circular_kernel_2` and guarantees exact constructions of Delaunay triangulations and dual objects when the input points have rational coordinates.

The model `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_CK_traits_2` is faster than `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_traits_2` for points with rational coordinates.
