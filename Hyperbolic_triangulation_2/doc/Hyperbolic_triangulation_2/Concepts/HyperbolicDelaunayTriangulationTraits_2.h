\cgalRefines DelaunayTriangulationTraits_2

The concept `HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2` describes the set of requirements
to be fulfilled by any class used to instantiate the first template parameter of the class
`CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_2<Traits, Tds>`. It defines the geometric objects
(points, segments...) forming the triangulation together with geometric predicates and
constructions on these objects.

This concept refines `DelaunayTriangulationTraits_2` because the class `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_2`
internally relies on the class `CGAL::Delaunay_triangulation_2`.
