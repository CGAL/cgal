checks whether `obj1` and `obj2` intersect.  Two objects `obj1` and
`obj2` intersect if there is a point `p` that is part of both `obj1`
and `obj2`.  The intersection region of those two objects is defined
as the set of all points `p` that are part of both `obj1` and `obj2`.
Note that while for a polygon we consider the enclosed domain, for an
object of type `Circle_2` only the curve is considered.

`Type1` and `Type2` can be any of
the following:

- `Line_2<CircularKernel>`
- `Circle_2<CircularKernel>`
- `Line_arc_2<CircularKernel>`
- `Circular_arc_2<CircularKernel>`

An example illustrating this is presented in
Chapter  \ref Chapter_2D_Circular_Geometry_Kernel.

The iterator versions of those functions can be used in conjunction
with `Dispatch_output_iterator`.

depend on the arguments, the function expects an output iterator on `K::Intersect_2(Type1, Type2)`
