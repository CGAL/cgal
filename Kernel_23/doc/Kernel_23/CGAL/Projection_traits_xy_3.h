\ingroup kernel_classes

The class `Projection_traits_xy_3` is an adapter to apply 2D algorithms to the projections of 3D data on the `xy`-plane.

\cgal provides also predefined geometric traits classes
`Projection_traits_yz_3<K>` and
`Projection_traits_xz_3<K>` to
deal with projections on the
`zx`- and the `zy`-plane,
respectively.

\tparam K must be a model of `Kernel`.

\note Internal constructions (projections) are used in the predicate and
construction functors of this class. If `K` is a model of `Kernel` providing exact
constructions or if `K` is a `CGAL::Filtered_kernel` (such as for
`CGAL::Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel`), this class automatically
provides exact predicates.

\cgalModels The class is a model of several 2D triangulation traits class concepts,
  except that it does not provide the type and constructors
  required to build the dual Voronoi diagram.

/*!
A construction object.
Provides the operator :

`boost::optional< boost::variant<Point_2,Segment_2> > operator()(Segment_2 s1, Segment_2 s2);`
which returns a 3D object whose projection on the xy-plane
is the intersection of the projections of `s1` and `s2`.
If non empty, the returned object is either a segment or a point.
Its embedding in 3D is computed as the interpolation
between `s1` and `s2`,
meaning that any point `p` of the returned object
is the midpoint of segment `p1p2` where `p1` and `p2` are the two points of `s1` and `s2` respectively, both projecting on `p`.
\pre The projection of `s1` and the projection of `s2` are non-degenerate `2D` segments.
