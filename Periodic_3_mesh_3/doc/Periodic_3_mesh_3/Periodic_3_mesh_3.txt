\section Periodic_3_mesh_3_section_intro Introduction

This package is devoted to the generation of isotropic simplicial
meshes discretizing periodic 3D domains.
The domain to be meshed is a subset of the three-dimensional flat torus
(see Section \ref P3Triangulation3secspace of the package \ref PkgPeriodic3Triangulation3).
The domain may be connected or composed of multiple components
and/or subdivided in several subdomains.
The current implementation provides classes to represent
domains bounded by isosurfaces of implicit functions defined over a cube.

Boundary and subdivision surfaces are either
smooth or piecewise-smooth surfaces, formed with planar or curved surface patches.
Surfaces may exhibit 1-dimensional features (e.g. crease edges)
and 0-dimensional features (e.g. singular points as corners
tips, cusps or darts), that have to be fairly approximated in the mesh.

The output mesh is a periodic 3-dimensional triangulation,
including subcomplexes that approximate each input domain feature: subdomain,
boundary surface patch or input domain feature with dimension 0 or 1.
Thus, the output mesh includes a 3D submesh covering each subdomain,
a surface mesh approximating each boundary or subdividing
surface patch, a polyline approximation for each
1-dimensional feature and of course a vertex on each corner.

The main entry points of the package are two global functions that
respectively generate and refine such meshes. The mesh generator is customized
to output a mesh that fits as much as possible the user needs,
for instance in terms of sizing field or with respect
to some user customized quality criteria.

The meshing engine used in this mesh generator is based on Delaunay
refinement \cgalCite{c-gqmgc-93}, \cgalCite{r-draq2d-95}, \cgalCite{s-tmgdr-98}.
It uses the notion of restricted Delaunay triangulation
to approximate 1-dimensional curves and surface patches \cgalCite{cgal:bo-pgsms-05}.
Before the refinement, a mechanism of protecting balls is set up on 1-dimensional features, if any,
to ensure a fair representation of those features in the mesh,
and also to guarantee the termination of the refinement process,
whatever may be the input geometry, in particular whatever small angles
the boundary and subdivision surface patches may form \cgalCite{cgal:cdl-pdma-07},
\cgalCite{cgal:cdr-drpsc-07}. The Delaunay refinement is followed
by a mesh optimization phase to remove slivers and provide a good quality mesh.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3Mesh_3 Relation to the 3D Mesh Generation and 3D Periodic Triangulations Packages

This package is fundamentally linked to the package \ref PkgMesh3,
which is devoted to the generation of isotropic simplicial
meshes discretizing (non-periodic) 3D domains and to the \ref PkgPeriodic3Triangulation3 of \cgal,
which are used as underlying triangulation structures of the mesh.

A periodic mesh extends, by definition, infinitely in space. We consider the flat torus \f$ \mathbb T_c^3\f$,
whose <I>canonical cube</I> has side length `c` (this canonical cube is named <I>original domain</I>
in Chapter \ref PkgPeriodic3Triangulation3; we rename it here to avoid the confusion
with the domain defined in Chapter \ref PkgMesh3). Well-chosen "dummy" points
are inserted at the beginning of the meshing process, ensuring that the projection
of the periodic triangulation into the flat torus \f$ \mathbb T_c^3\f$ forms at all times a simplicial complex
(see Sections \ref P3Triangulation3secspace and \ref P3Triangulation3secintro
of the manual of 3D periodic triangulations).
Thanks to this construction, the meshing process can be exclusively conducted
within the canonical cube.
The mesh can then be created using the \ref PkgMesh3 package of \cgal.
As this package originally aims to mesh non-periodic domains of \f$ \mathbb R^3\f$, an interface
is necessary between the packages \ref PkgMesh3 and \ref PkgPeriodic3Triangulation3.
This package provides this interface.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3InputDomain Input Domain

The domain to be meshed is assumed to be representable as a pure 3D complex.
A 3D complex is a set of faces with dimension 0, 1, 2, and 3
such that all faces are pairwise interior disjoint, and the boundary
of each face of the complex is the union of lower-dimensional faces of the complex.
The 3D complex is *pure*, meaning that each face is included in a face of dimension 3,
so that the complex is entirely described by the set of its 3D faces and their subfaces.
However the 3D complex needs not be connected.
The set of faces with dimension lower or equal than 2 forms a 2D
subcomplex which needs not be manifold, neither pure, nor connected:
some 3D faces may have dangling 2D or 1D faces in their boundary faces.

In the rest of the documentation, we will refer to the
input 3D complex as the input domain. The faces of the input domain
with dimension 0, 1, 2, and 3 are called respectively
<I>corners</I>, <I>curves</I>, <I>surface patches</I>, and <I>subdomains</I>
to clearly distinguish them from the faces of the mesh
that are called vertices, edges, facets and cells.

Note that the input complex faces are not required to be linear nor smooth.
Surface patches, for instance, may be smooth surface patches,
or portions of surface meshes with boundaries.
Curves may be for instance straight segments, parameterized curves,
or polylines. Each of those features will be accurately represented in the final mesh.

The 0 and 1-dimensional features of the input domain are usually singular points
of the subdomain boundaries, however this is not required. Furthermore, those features
are not required to cover all the subdomains boundaries singularities
but only those that need to be accurately represented in the final mesh.
In the following, we say that a domain has <I>features</I> when it has 0 and
1-dimensional features that need to be accurately represented in the mesh,
and we call those features <I>exposed features</I>.
Therefore, a domain may be without features either because all boundary surface patches
are smooth closed surfaces, or simply because the curves joining different surface patches
and the singularities of those patches need not be accurately approximated
in the final mesh.

Note also that input complex faces are not required to be connected.
Faces of the input domain are identified by indices.
If a subdomain is not connected, its different components receive the same index.
Likewise different surface patches, segment curves, or corners may share the same index.
Each connected component of a feature will be accurately represented
in the final mesh.
Note however that the occurrence of multiply connected faces in the
input complex may affect the relevance of internal topological checks
performed by the mesh generator.

The domain is passed to the mesh generation function
as a domain class, often called the oracle,
that provides predicates and constructors related to the domain,
the subdomains, and the boundary surface patches.
Mainly, the oracle provides a predicate to test
if a given query point belongs to the domain or not
and to find in which subdomain it lies in the affirmative case.
The domain class also provides predicates and constructors to test the intersection of a query line segment
with the boundary surface patches and to construct intersection points, if any.

\subsubsection Periodic_3_mesh_3ImplicitInputDomain Implicit Domains

An implicit domain is a domain described by an implicit function. The bounding surface
is described implicitly as the zero level set of a function defined
over the three dimensional flat torus.
The domain to be discretized is assumed to be the domain where
the function has negative values.

\subsubsection Periodic_3_mesh_3InputDomainPeriodicity Periodicity of the Input Domain

As described in Section \ref Periodic_3_mesh_3Mesh_3, the periodic mesh is in fact
constructed over a single cube of side `c` in \f$ \mathbb R^3\f$, the <I>canonical cube</I>
of the flat torus \f$ \mathbb T_c^3\f$. The origin (given by three coordinates \f$ \alpha\f$, \f$ \beta\f$,
and \f$ \gamma\f$) of this cube and the period `c` are input parameters chosen
by the user. The cube \f$ [\alpha,\alpha+c)\times[\beta,\beta+c)\times[\gamma,\gamma+c)\f$
contains exactly one representative of each element in \f$ \mathbb T_c^3\f$.
Although the mesh is only constructed over the canonical cube, some of the oracles
used during the generation of the mesh must sometimes be evaluated outside of the canonical cube.
The implicit function describing the domain to be meshed must thus be defined
over the whole Euclidean space and be periodic, with a period compatible with the canonical cube.

\subsubsection Periodic_3_mesh_3ArtificialPeriodicity Enforcing Domain Periodicity

The specifications of the input implicit function described in the previous section are quite restrictive.
To relax these requirements, this package also offers a wrapper class,
`CGAL::Periodic_3_function_wrapper`, to artificially construct
periodic functions compatible with the user-defined canonical cube,
from the values of an implicit function over the canonical cube.
It is thus possible to construct periodic domains described by implicit functions
that are not intrinsically periodic, for example a sphere (see \cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_implicit_sphere})
or a cone (see Section \ref Periodic_3_mesh_3ConeWithSharpFeatures).

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3OutputMesh Output Mesh

The resulting mesh is output as a subcomplex of a
\ref CGAL::Periodic_3_regular_triangulation_3 "weighted Delaunay periodic 3D triangulation",
in a class that provides various iterators on mesh elements.

This periodic 3D triangulation provides approximations of the subdomains,
surface patches, curves, and corners according to the restricted
Delaunay triangulation paradigm. This means that each subdomain is approximated
by the union of the tetrahedral cells whose circumcenters are located inside
the domain (or subdomain).
Each surface patch is approximated by the union of the Delaunay mesh facets
whose dual Voronoi edges intersect the surface patch. Such mesh facets are called
<I>surface facets</I> in the following. The 1-dimensional exposed features
are approximated by sequences of mesh edges and the 0-dimensional exposed features
are represented by mesh vertices.

It is possible to extract the facets of the complex (restricted to the canonical cube)
as a `FaceGraph`, using the function `facets_in_complex_3_to_triangle_mesh()`.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3DelaunayRefinement Delaunay Refinement

The mesh generation algorithm is mainly a Delaunay refinement process.
This Delaunay refinement process is driven by criteria
concerning either the size and shape of mesh cells
and surface facets.
The refinement process terminates when there are
no more mesh cells or surface facets violating the criteria.

The criteria are designed to achieve a nice spread of the mesh vertices
while ensuring the termination of the refinement process.
Those criteria may be somehow tuned to the user needs
to achieve for instance the respect of a sizing field by mesh elements,
some topological conditions on the representation of boundary surfaces in the mesh,
and/or some error bound for the approximation of boundary surfaces.
To some extent, the user may tune the Delaunay refinement
to a prescribed trade-off between mesh quality and mesh density.
The mesh density refers to the number of mesh vertices and cells,
i.e.\ to the complexity of the mesh.
The mesh quality referred to here is measured by the radius edge
ratio of surface facets end mesh cells, where the radius edge ratio of
a simplex (triangle or tetrahedron) is the ratio between its circumradius
and its shortest edge length.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3Protectionof0and1dimensionalExposed Protection of 0 and 1-dimensional Exposed Features

If the domain description includes 0 dimensional features,
the corresponding points are inserted into the Delaunay triangulation
from the start.

If the domain has 1-dimensional exposed features,
the method of protecting balls \cgalCite{cgal:cdl-pdma-07}, \cgalCite{cgal:cdr-drpsc-07}
is used to achieve an accurate representation of those features in the mesh
and to guarantee that the refinement process terminates
whatever may be the dihedral angles formed by input surface patches incident to a
given 1-feature or the angles formed by two 1-features incident to a 0-feature.
See Section \ref Mesh_3Protectionof0and1dimensionalExposed in the documentation
of the package \ref PkgMesh3 for further information.

Section \ref Periodic_3_mesh_3MeshingDomainswithSharpFeatures details how
to prescribe sharp features and examples of periodic meshes with features.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3OptimizationPhase Optimization Phase

The optimization phase is a succession of optimization processes which aim to
improve the quality of the mesh in terms of shape of its elements.
All the optimizers offered by the package \ref PkgMesh3 are also available
for periodic mesh generation:

- The Lloyd and ODT-smoother are global optimizers, moving the mesh vertices
to minimize a mesh energy.
- The perturber and the exuder are local optimizers, focusing on improving
the worst mesh elements.

See Sections \ref Mesh_3OptimizationPhase, \ref Mesh_3TheOptimizationParameters,
and \ref Mesh_3TuningMeshOptimization in the documentation of the package \ref PkgMesh3
for further information.

\section Periodic_3_mesh_3_section_interface Interface

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3TheGlobalFunctions The Global Functions

A periodic 3D mesh generation process is launched through a call
to one of the two following functions:

\code{.cpp}
template <class C3T3, class PeriodicMeshDomain, class MeshCriteria>
C3T3 make_periodic_3_mesh_3(const PeriodicMeshDomain& domain,
                            const MeshCriteria& criteria,
                            parameters::internal::Features_options features = parameters::features(domain),
                            parameters::internal::Lloyd_options lloyd = parameters::no_lloyd(),
                            parameters::internal::Odt_options odt = parameters::no_odt(),
                            parameters::internal::Perturb_options perturb = parameters::perturb(),
                            parameters::internal::Exude_options exude = parameters::exude());

template <class C3T3, class MeshDomain, class MeshCriteria>
void refine_periodic_3_mesh_3(C3T3& c3t3,
                              const PeriodicMeshDomain& domain,
                              const MeshCriteria& criteria,
                              parameters::internal::Lloyd_options lloyd = parameters::no_lloyd(),
                              parameters::internal::Odt_options odt = parameters::no_odt(),
                              parameters::internal::Perturb_options perturb = parameters::perturb(),
                              parameters::internal::Exude_options exude = parameters::exude());
\endcode

The function `make_periodic_3_mesh_3()` generates from scratch a periodic mesh
of the input domain, while the function `refine_periodic_3_mesh_3()` refines
an existing periodic mesh of the input domain.

\warning The triangulation must form at all times a simplicial complex within
a single copy of the domain (see Sections \ref P3Triangulation3secspace and \ref P3Triangulation3secintro
of the manual of 3D periodic triangulations). It is the responsibility of the user to provide
a triangulation that satisfies this condition when calling the refinement
function `refine_periodic_3_mesh_3()`. The underlying triangulation of a mesh
complex obtained through `make_periodic_3_mesh_3()` or `refine_periodic_3_mesh_3()`
will always satisfy this condition.

The following sections describe the different template parameters
(and their requirements) of these two global functions.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3TheDataStructure The Data Structure

The template parameter `C3T3` is required to be a model of
the concept `MeshComplex_3InTriangulation_3`. This data structure is devised to
represent a three-dimensional complex embedded in a periodic 3D triangulation.
In both functions, an instance of type `C3T3` is used to maintain the current
approximating simplicial mesh and to represent a single copy of
the final periodic 3D mesh at the end of the procedure.

The embedding periodic 3D triangulation is required to be the nested type
`CGAL::Periodic_3_mesh_triangulation_3::type`, provided by the class template
`CGAL::Periodic_3_mesh_triangulation_3`. The type for this triangulation is a
wrapper around the class `CGAL::Periodic_3_regular_triangulation_3` whose vertex and cell
base classes are respectively models of the concepts `MeshVertexBase_3` and
`MeshCellBase_3`.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3TheDomainOracleandtheFeaturesParameter The Domain Oracle and the Features Parameter

The template parameter `PeriodicMeshDomain` is required to be a model of
the concept `Periodic_3MeshDomain_3`. The argument `domain` of type
`PeriodicMeshDomain` is the sole link through which the periodic domain
to be discretized is known by the mesh generation algorithm.

This concept provides, among others, member functions to test whether or not
a query segment intersects boundary surfaces, and to compute an intersection point
in the affirmative.
The `Periodic_3MeshDomain_3` concept adds member functions which given a query point
tell whether the point lies inside or outside the domain and in which subdomain
the point lies, if inside.

If the domain description includes 0 and 1-dimensional features
that have to be accurately represented in the final mesh,
the template parameter `PeriodicMeshDomain` is required to be
of a model of the concept `Periodic_3MeshDomainWithFeatures_3`,
which mainly provides the incidence graph of 0, 1 and 2-dimensional features,
and a member function to construct sample points on curves.

Users whose domain is a model of `Periodic_3MeshDomainWithFeatures_3`
can choose to have the corners and curves of the domain
represented in the mesh or not, using the following parameters:
<UL>
<LI>`parameters::features()` sets features according to the domain,
i.e.\ 0 and 1-dimensional features are taken into account if `domain` is a
`MeshDomainWithFeatures_3`.
<LI>`parameters::no_features()` prevents the representation
of 0 and 1-dimensional features in the mesh. This is useful to get a smooth and rough approximation
of a domain with features.
</UL>

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3TheMeshingCriteria The Meshing Criteria

The template parameter `MeshCriteria` must be a model of the concept
`MeshCriteria_3`, or a model of the refined concept `MeshCriteriaWithFeatures_3`
if the domain has exposed features.
The argument of type `MeshCriteria` passed to the mesh generator specifies the
size and shape requirements for the tetrahedra in the mesh
and for the triangles in the boundary surface mesh. These criteria
condition the rules that drive the refinement process. At the end
of the refinement process, mesh elements satisfy the criteria.
This may not be strictly true anymore after the optimization phase, but this
last phase is devised to only improve the mesh quality.

The periodic mesher makes use of the same criteria as the non-periodic meshing functions.
This is made possible because criteria use methods directly
from the underlying triangulation, to know the smallest edge length of a triangle,
for example. The periodicity is therefore taken into account at this level and
no modification of the criteria classes are required.

The criteria for surface facets are governed by the four following
parameters:
<UL>
<LI><I>`facet_angle`.</I> This parameter controls the shape of
surface facets. Specifically, it is a lower bound for the angle (in degree) of
surface facets. When boundary surfaces are smooth, the termination of the meshing process is
guaranteed if this angular bound is at most 30 degrees \cgalCite{c-gqmgc-93}.
<LI><I>`facet_size`.</I> This parameter controls the size of surface facets.
Each surface facet has
a surface Delaunay ball which is a ball circumscribing the surface facet and
centered on the surface patch. The parameter `facet_size` is
either a constant or a spatially variable scalar field, providing an
upper bound for the radii of surface Delaunay balls.
<LI><I>`facet_distance`.</I> This parameter controls the approximation error of boundary and subdivision surfaces.
Specifically, it is
either a constant or a spatially variable scalar field. It
provides an upper bound for the distance between the circumcenter
of a surface facet and the center of a surface Delaunay ball of this facet.
<LI><I>`facet_topology`.</I> This parameters controls the set of topological constraints
which have to be verified by each surface facet. By default, each vertex of a surface
facet has to be located on a surface patch, on a curve, or on a corner. It can
also be set to check whether the three vertices of a surface facet belongs to the same
surface patch. This has to be done cautiously, as such a criterion needs that each
intersection of input surface patches is an input 1-dimensional feature.
</UL>

The criteria for mesh cells are governed by two parameters:
<UL>
<LI><I>`cell_radius_edge_ratio`.</I> This parameter controls the
shape of mesh cells (but can't filter slivers, as we discussed earlier).
It is an upper bound for the ratio
between the circumradius of a
mesh tetrahedron and its shortest edge.
There is a theoretical bound for this parameter:
the Delaunay refinement process is guaranteed to terminate
for values of `cell_radius_edge_ratio` bigger than 2.
<LI><I>`cell_size`.</I>
This parameter controls the size of mesh tetrahedra.
It is either a scalar or a spatially variable scalar field.
It provides an upper bound on the circumradii of the
mesh tetrahedra.
</UL>

If the domain has 1-dimensional exposed features, the `criteria` includes
a sizing field to guide the sampling of 1-dimensional features with protecting balls centers.
<UL>
<LI><I>`edge_size`</I>. This constant or variable scalar field is used as an upper bound for the distance between two
protecting ball centers that are consecutive on a 1-feature. This parameter has to be set to a positive value when
1-dimensional features protection is used.
</UL>

\section Periodic_3_mesh_3_section_examples Examples

This section presents various use cases of the periodic mesh generator.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3SubMultipleCopies Visualizing Multiple Copies of a Periodic Mesh

Generated meshes can be output to the `.mesh` file format, which can be visualized with the demo
of the package \ref PkgPolyhedron. The function \link PkgPeriodic3Mesh3IOFunctions `CGAL::IO::output_periodic_mesh_to_medit()` \endlink
takes a stream, a mesh complex, and - optionally - the number of periodic copies that should be drawn,
making it easier to observe the periodicity of the result.
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_copies} illustrates the different output
for the three possible number of copies: `1`, `4`, and `8`.

</center>
\cgalFigureCaptionBegin{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_copies}
Example of a periodic mesh output in `1`, `4`, or `8` copies.
\cgalFigureCaptionEnd

In the following examples (except on \cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_multi_domain}),
each copy of a periodic mesh will be attributed a unique color.

\warning A single copy of the periodic mesh does not necessarily form a visually-pleasing mesh:
there can be unexpected holes, disconnected elements, non-manifold locations, etc.
This is because each copy is only made of unique elements and the periodic mesh
only has meaning when considered with other neighboring periodic copies:
a strange hole on the "left" of a copy is filled by a tetrahedron on its "right".
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_protection} is an example of such phenomenon:
These (purely visual) issues disappear when considering multiple copies together.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_33DDomainsImplicitIsosurfaces 3D Periodic Domains Bounded by Implicit Isosurfaces
The following code produces a 3D periodic mesh for a domain whose boundary surface
is an isosurface defined by an implicit function.
Note the use of named parameters (from the Boost library) in the
constructor of the `Mesh_criteria` instance.
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_implicit_shape} shows the resulting mesh.

\cgalExample{Periodic_3_mesh_3/mesh_implicit_shape.cpp}

A single copy of a periodic mesh produced from an implicit domain (left).
Cut view (middle). Another cut is shown, using 8 copies (right).
\cgalFigureCaptionEnd

While the implicit function used in the previous example is defined and periodic
over the complete space, it is also possible to consider non-periodic implicit functions
defined entirely within the canonical cube (or over the whole space) by using the wrapper class
`CGAL::Periodic_3_function_wrapper`. Values will then be periodically duplicated, creating
a periodic function. For example, replacing the previous domain with the following
non-periodic implicit function (a sphere):

\code{.cpp}
...
typedef CGAL::Periodic_3_function_wrapper<Function, K>              Periodic_function;
...
// A sphere centered on (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) with radius sqrt(0.2)
FT sphere_function (const Point& p) { return CGAL::squared_distance(p, Point(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)) - 0.2; }
...
Iso_cuboid_3 canonical_cube(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1);
Periodic_mesh_domain domain =
  Periodic_mesh_domain::create_implicit_mesh_domain(
    Periodic_function(sphere_function, canonical_cube), canonical_cube );
...
\endcode

will yield the mesh shown on \cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_implicit_sphere}.

\subsubsection Periodic_3_mesh_33DDomainsImplicitIsosurfacesBothSides Meshing the Interior and the Exterior of a Domain Bounded by an Isosurface
In the case of periodic mesh generation, the exterior of an isosurface defined by
an implicit function can also be meshed because it is a finite space.
The class `Implicit_to_labeled_subdomains_function_wrapper` is a convenient wrapper
to achieve this by internally transforming the interior and the exterior as simply
two subdomains to be meshed. Compared to the previous example, it can be simply achieved
by adding the line
\code{.cpp}
...
typedef CGAL::Implicit_to_labeled_subdomains_function_wrapper<Function, K> Function_wrapper;
...
\endcode
and wrapping the function as follows:
\code{.cpp}
...
Function_wrapper wrapper(schwarz_p);
Periodic_mesh_domain domain(wrapper, canonical_cube);
...
\endcode

\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_implicit_interior_and_exterior} shows
the periodic mesh obtained after this change. Note that both subdomains are meshed
with different cell sizing fields, which can be obtained using the class
`Mesh_constant_domain_field_3`. See Example \ref Periodic_3_mesh_3/mesh_implicit_shape_with_subdomains.cpp
"mesh_implicit_shape_with_subdomains.cpp" for the complete code.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3MeshingMultipleDomains Meshing Multiple Domains

The following code produces a 3D periodic mesh for a domain consisting of a combination
of the two implicit functions used in the previous example: a sphere is encompassed
within the implicit domain of \cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_implicit_shape}.
The class `Implicit_multi_domain_to_labeling_function_wrapper` is used as model
of `ImplicitFunction`, required by the class `Labeled_mesh_domain_3`.
The set of subdomains is given by a vector of vector of signs.
Each subdomain corresponds to a sign vector `[s1, s2, ..., sn]`,
where `si` is the sign of the function `fi(p)` at a point `p` of the subdomain.
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_multi_domain} shows a view and a cut view of the resulting mesh.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3Optimizers Tuning Mesh Optimization

In the previous examples, the mesh generation is launched through a call
`make_periodic_3_mesh_3()` with a minimal number of parameters. In such cases,
the default optimization strategy is applied: after the Delaunay refinement process
two optimization steps are performed, a perturbation and a sliver exudation.
The following example shows how to enable and disable the various optimization methods.
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_multi_domain} shows the resulting periodic mesh
before and after optimizations.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3MeshingDomainswithSharpFeatures Meshing Domains with Sharp Features

The periodic mesh generator currently operates on domains described by one or
multiple implicit functions. Sharp features to be preserved
must then be explicitly specified by hand by the user, using the mesh domain
class `CGAL::Mesh_domain_with_polyline_features_3` and its functions
`add_corners()` and `add_features()`.
These functions allow to specify curves (as a polyline -- a list of points
with two consecutive points forming a segment of the curve) and
corners which should appear in the final mesh.
Note that the discretization of the specified curves might change: for example,
a curve might be subdivided in smaller segments or simplified in larger segments,
but the prescribed geometry will still be present in the final mesh.

To ensure the good protection of features, some requirements are put on the curves
and corners that are specified by the user:
- A corner can only belong to a curve if it is an endpoint of that curve.
- A curve cannot self-intersect, except at its endpoint (it then forms a so-called `cycle`).
- Two curves cannot intersect, except at a common endpoint.

\warning For conveniency, curves and corners do not need to be restricted
to the canonical cube, but users should be mindful that curves and corners will exist
in all periodic copies and the requirements described above must be satisfied.
For example, if considering the unit cube as canonical cube, it is not valid
to add the segment `(2,2,2)--(3,3,3)` as feature and the point `(1.5, 1.5, 1.5)`
as corner: once the periodicity is taken in account, the point is actually the middle
of the segment.

\subsubsection Periodic_3_mesh_3ConeWithSharpFeatures Example of a Cone-like Periodic Domain

The example below uses two different types of protecting features: a cycle to
protect the base of the cone, and a corner at the apex of a cone, which ensures
that the apex will appear in the mesh.
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_protection} shows the comparison between
the same domain meshed with the same criteria when protection is disabled and enabled.

Note the use of a more complex intrinsically non-periodic implicit function as input domain.

\cgalFigureCaptionBegin{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_protection}
A periodic mesh obtained with a cone-like periodic implicit function (8 copies
are drawn). The base and the apex of the cone
are badly approximated when protection is unused (left).
Using protection, we obtain a faithful approximation.
(Facets seemingly disconnected from other facets of the same color are due to the fact that
a single copy of the mesh does not necessarily form a visually pleasing mesh by itself;
see Section \ref Periodic_3_mesh_3SubMultipleCopies for more details.)

\subsubsection Periodic_3_mesh_3InfiniteFeatures Example of Protecting Curves Extending Continuously Over Multiple Periodic Copies

It is possible to prescribe features that will, due to periodicity, form a
continuous polyline that extends infinitely in space.
A simple example of such occurrence is the segment `(0,0,0) -- (1,1,1)` when
considering the unit cube as canonical cube.
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_protection} shows an implicit function
describing a square-based prism such that the axis of the prism is the (Oz) axis.
(The prism is thus 'cut' into 4 pieces when considered within a single copy of the periodic space.)
The canonical cube is the unit cube and the following polylines have been specified to protect edges:
\code
  // These are four vertical edges (orthogonal to xOy), strictly in the domain.
  // They correspond to the four sharp edges of the prism.
  LV0: ( 0.3,  0.3, -1) -- ( 0.3,  0.3, 0) // canonically, (0.3, 0.3, 0) -- (0.3, 0.3, 1)
  LV1: ( 1.7,  1.7,  2) -- ( 1.7,  1.7, 3) // canonically, (0.7, 0.7, 0) -- (0.7, 0.7, 1)
  LV2: ( 0.7,  0.3,  4) -- ( 0.7,  0.3, 5) // canonically, (0.7, 0.3, 0) -- (0.7, 0.3, 1)
  LV3: (-0.7, -0.3,  6) -- (-0.7, -0.3, 7) // canonically, (0.3, 0.7, 0) -- (0.3, 0.7, 1)

  // These are four vertical edges (orthogonal to xOy) on the border of the domain.
  // The prism does not intrinsically possess a sharp feature at these locations;
  // rather, these edges are protected to artificially create features on the border of the domain.
  LV4: (0.3, 0,   0) -- (0.3, 0,   1)
  LV5: (0,   1.3, 0) -- (0,   1.3, 1) // canonically, (0.,  0.3, 0) -- (0.,  0.3, 1)
  LV6: (0,   0.7, 0) -- (0,   0.7, 1)
  LV7: (2.7, 2,   0) -- (2.7, 2,   1) // canonically, (0.7, 0.,  0) -- (0.7, 0.,  1)

  // These are four horizontal edges (in the plane xOy) on the border of the domain.
  // As the last four polylines, these polylines do not correspond to a sharp feature
  // on the prism, but are rather just for aesthetics.
  //
  // Note that these polylines cross the border of the input cube.
  LH0: ( 0.3,  0.3, 0) -- ( 0.3, -0.3, 0)
  LH1: ( 0.3, -0.3, 1) -- (-0.3, -0.3, 1)
  LH2: (-0.3, -0.3, 2) -- (-0.3,  0.3, 2)
  LH3: (-0.3,  0.3, 3) -- ( 0.3,  0.3, 3)

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3ImplementationHistory Implementation History

The work on this package started during the PhD thesis of Mikhail Bogdanov,
advised by Monique Teillaud, which resulted in a first prototype.

From the beginning of 2014, most of the work was performed by Aymeric
Pellé, in collaboration with Monique Teillaud.
Their collaboration produced a first set of design and specifications \cgalCite{cgal:pt-rs-14}.

This initial implementation was enhanced by Mael Rouxel-Labbé in 2017, in collaboration
with Monique Teillaud, to provide a more robust implementation, integrate optimizations,
handle 0- and 1-dimensional features, and publish the first version of this package.
