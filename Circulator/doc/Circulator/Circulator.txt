\section CirculatorHandles Handles

Most data structures in \cgal use the concept of `Handle` in their user
interface to refer to the elements they store. This concept describes what is
sometimes called a trivial iterator. A `Handle` is akeen to a pointer to
an object providing the dereference operator `operator*()` and member
access `operator->()` but no increment or decrement operators like
iterators. A `Handle` is intended to be used whenever the referenced
object is not part of a logical sequence.

<b>Model for a handle</b> A simple pointer `T*`, an iterator or a circulator with value type
`T`, are also handles.

\section CirculatorRanges Ranges

Most data structures in \cgal use the concept of an iterator range. The
`Range` and `ConstRange` concepts encapsulate the access to the first
and the past-the-end iterators of an iterator range. STL containers are models
of `Range`. The Boost.Range library provides good support around this
concept as well.

\section circulatorsCirculators Circulators

An introduction to the concept of circulators is given here. A couple
of adaptors are presented that convert between iterators and
circulators. Some useful functions for circulators follow. This
chapter concludes with a discussion of the design decisions taken. For
the full description of the circulator requirements, the provided base
classes, the circulator tags, and the support for generic algorithms
that work for iterators as well as for circulators please refer to the
reference pages. Note that circulators are not part of \stl, but of \cgal.

\subsection sectionIntroduction Introduction

The concept of iterators in \stl is tailored for linear
sequences \cgalCite{cgal:ansi-is14882-98}, \cgalCite{cgal:ms-strg-96}. In contrast, circular
sequences occur naturally in many combinatorial and geometric
structures. Examples are polyhedral surfaces and planar maps, where
the edges emanating from a vertex or the edges around a facet form a
circular sequence.

Since circular sequences do not allow for efficient iterators, we have
introduced the new concept of <I>circulators</I>. They share most of
the requirements of iterators, while the main difference is the lack
of a past-the-end position in the sequence. Appropriate adaptors are
provided between iterators and circulators to integrate circulators
smoothly into the framework of \stl. An example of a generic `contains` function illustrates the use of circulators. As usual for
circular structures, a `do`-`while` loop is preferable, such
that for the specific input, `c == d`, all elements in the
sequence are reached.

\code{.cpp}
template <class Circulator, class T>
bool contains( Circulator c, Circulator d, const T& value) {
  if (c != 0) {
    do {
      if (*c == value)
        return true;
    } while (++c != d);
  }
  return false;
}
\endcode

Three circulator categories are defined: forward, bidirectional and
random-access circulators. Given a circulator `c`, the operation
`*c` denotes the item the circulator refers to. The operation `++c` advances the circulator by one item and `-c` steps a
bidirectional circulator one item backwards. For random-access
circulators `c+n` advances the circulator `n` steps. Two
circulators can be compared for equality.

Circulators have a different notion of reachability and ranges than
iterators. A circulator `d` is called <I>reachable</I> from a
circulator `c` if `c` can be made equal to `d` with
finitely many applications of the operator `++`. Due to the
circularity of the sequence this is always true if both circulators
refer to items of the same sequence. In particular, `c` is always
reachable from `c`. Given two circulators `c` and `d`, the
range `[c,d)` denotes all circulators obtained by starting with
`c` and advancing `c` until `d` is reached, but does not
include `d`, for `d != c`. So far it is the same
range definition as for iterators. The difference lies in the use of
`[c,c)` to denote all items in the circular sequence, whereas for
an iterator `i` the range `[i,i)` denotes the empty range. As
long as `c != d` the range `[c,d)` behaves like an iterator
range and could be used in \stl algorithms. For circulators however,
an additional test `c == NULL` is required that returns true if
and only if the circular sequence is empty. As for
\cpp, we recommend the use of 0 instead of `NULL`.

Besides the conceptual cleanness, the main reason for inventing a new
concept with a similar intent as iterators is efficiency. An iterator
is supposed to be a light-weight object - merely a pointer and a
single indirection to advance the iterator. Although iterators could
be written for circular sequences, we do not know of an efficient
solution. The missing past-the-end situation in circular sequences can
be solved with an arbitrary sentinel in the cyclic order, but this
would destroy the natural symmetry in the structure (which is in
itself a bad idea) and additional bookkeeping in the items and
checking in the iterator advance method reduces efficiency. Another
solution may use more bookkeeping in the iterator, e.g. with a start
item, a current item, and a kind of winding-number that is zero for
the `begin()`-iterator and one for the past-the-end
situation\cgalFootnote{This is currently implemented as the adaptor class which provides a pair of iterators for a given circulator.}. We have introduced the concept of circulators
that allows light-weight implementations and the \cgal support
library provides adaptor classes that convert between iterators and
circulators (with the corresponding penalty in efficiency), so as to
integrate this new concept into the framework of \stl.

A serious design problem is the slight change of the semantic for
circulator ranges as compared to iterator ranges. Since this semantic
is defined by the intuitive operators `++` and `==`, which we
would like to keep for circulators as well, circulator ranges can be
used in \stl algorithms. This is in itself a useful feature, if there
would not be the definition of a full range `[c, c)` that
an \stl algorithm will treat as an empty range. However, the
likelihood of a mistake may be overestimated, since for a container
`C` supporting circulators there is no `end()` member
function, and an expression such as `std::sort( C.begin(),
C.end())` will fail. It is easy to distinguish iterators and
circulators at compile time, which allows for generic algorithms
supporting both as arguments. It is also possible to protect
algorithms against inappropriate arguments using the same technique,
see the reference pages for circulators, specifically the
`Assert_iterator()` and `is_empty_range()` functions.

\anchor sectionCirculatorWarning
\attention Please note that the definition of a range is different
from that of iterators. An interface of a data structure must declare
whether it works with iterators, circulators, or both. \stl 
algorithms always specify only iterators in their interfaces. A range
`[c, d)` of circulators used in an interface for iterators
will work as expected as long as `c != d`. A range `[c, c)` will be 
interpreted as the empty range like for iterators,
which is different than the full range that it should denote for
circulators.

\subsection sectionCirculatorAdaptor Adaptors Between Iterators and Circulators

Algorithms working on iterator ranges can not be applied to circulator
ranges in full generality, only to subranges as pointed out in the 
previous section. The following adaptors
convert circulators to iterators and vice versa (with the unavoidable
space and time penalty) to reestablish this generality.


- `Container_from_circulator` is a container-like class with iterators built from a circulator
- `Circulator_from_iterator` is a circulator over a range of two iterators
- `Circulator_from_container` is a circulator for a container


The following example applies the generic `std::reverse()` algorithm 
from \stl to a sequence given by a bidirectional circulator `c`.
It uses the `Container_from_circulator` adaptor.

\code{.cpp}
Circulator c; // c must be at least bidirectional.
CGAL::Container_from_circulator<Circulator> container(c);
std::reverse( container.begin(), container.end());
\endcode

Another example defines a circulator `c` for a vector of
`int`'s. However, since there are no elements in the vector, the
circulator denotes an empty sequence. If there were elements in the
vector, the circulator would implement a random access modulus the
size of the sequence.

\code{.cpp}
std::vector<int> v;
typedef CGAL::Circulator_from_iterator< std::vector<int>::iterator > Circulator;
Circulator c( v.begin(), v.end());
\endcode

\subsection sectionCirculatorFunctions Functions on Circulators

Several functions deal with circulators and circulator ranges. The type
`C` denotes a circulator. The type `IC` denotes either a circulator
or an iterator. More on algorithms that work with circulators as well with
iterators can be found in the reference pages.

\code{.cpp}
C c, d;
IC ic1, ic2;

circulator_size(c);          // size of the sequence reachable by c
circulator_distance(c, d);   // number of elements in the range [c, d)
iterator_distance(ic1, ic2); // number of elements in the range [ic2, ic1)
is_empty_range(ic1, ic2);    // test the range [ic2, ic1) for emptiness
\endcode
