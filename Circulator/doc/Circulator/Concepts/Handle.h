\cgalConcept

Most data structures in \cgal use the concept of `Handle` in their user
interface to refer to the elements they store. This concept describes what is
sometimes called a trivial iterator. A `Handle` is akin to a pointer to
an object providing the dereference operator `operator*()` and member
access `operator->()` but no increment or decrement operators like
iterators. A `Handle` is intended to be used whenever the referenced
object is not part of a logical sequence.

Like iterators, the handle can be passed as template argument to
`std::iterators_traits` in order to extract its `value_type`,
the type of the element pointed to.
The `iterator_category` is `void`.

\cgalRefines Descriptor

The default constructed object must be unique as far as the equality
operator is concerned (this serves the same purpose as NULL for pointers).
(Note that this is not a generally supported feature of iterators of
standard containers.)
