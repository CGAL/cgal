Shape Detection

This CGAL package implements the Efficient RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) approach
for detecting arbitrary shapes in an unorganized point set with unoriented normals
and the Region Growing approach for detecting shapes in a set of arbitrary items.
For the latter approach, CGAL provides three particular instances of the algorithm:
detecting lines in a 2D point set, detecting planes in a 3D point set,
and detecting planes on a polygon mesh.
