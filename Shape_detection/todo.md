- update the docs
- ---- submission ----
- update the polyhedron demo
- make a better version of the Polyline_graph where I return a filtered set of original edges instead of PEdge
- add new tests: polyline (2D, 3D), polyline with sorting (2D, 3D), free functions, randomness, strict tests on the data from PMP, tests similar to the basic_example, check polylines with equal points
- add missing deprecated constructors
- think about changing lvalue to readable property maps
- put all property names in the named parameters
