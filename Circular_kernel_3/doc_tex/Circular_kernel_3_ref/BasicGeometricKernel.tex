\begin{ccRefConcept}{LinearKernel} 

\ccDefinition

The geometric kernel parameter of \ccc{CGAL::Spherical_kernel_3} is
supposed to be a model of the \textit{(three-dimensional)} \ccc{Kernel}
concept, so that the spherical kernel provides all functionalities of a
\cgal\ kernel.

%In fact, even though all types and operations of the
%\ccc{CGAL::Kernel} concept are required so that
%\ccc{CGAL::Circular_kernel_2} actually refines \ccc{CGAL::Kernel}, only
%the following types are explicitly used by \ccc{Circular_kernel_2} and
%can thus be considered as minimal requirements:

%\ccNestedType{RT}{A model of \ccc{RingNumberType}.}
%\ccNestedType{FT}{A model of \ccc{FieldNumberType<RT>}.} \footnote{concept template...?}

%\ccNestedType{Point_2}{A model of \ccc{Point_2}.}
%\ccNestedType{Line_2}{A model of \ccc{Line_2}.}
%\ccNestedType{Circle_2}{A model of \ccc{Circle_2}.}
%\ccNestedType{Object_2}{A model of \ccc{Object_2}.}

%Note that all operations on these types are also required.
