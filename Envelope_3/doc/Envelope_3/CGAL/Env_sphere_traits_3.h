The traits class `Env_sphere_traits_3` models the `EnvelopeTraits_3`
concept, and is used for the construction of lower and upper envelopes
of spheres. Note that when projecting the intersection curve of two
spheres (a circle in 3D) onto the \f$ xy\f$-plane, the resulting curve is an
ellipse. The traits class is therefore parameterized by an
arrangement-traits class that is capable of handling conic
curves - namely an instantiation of the `Arr_conic_traits_2`
class-template - and inherits from it.

The conic-traits class defines a nested type named `Rat_kernel`,
which is a geometric kernel parameterized by an exact rational type.
`Env_sphere_traits_3` defines its `Surface_3` type to be constructible from
`Rat_kernel::Sphere_3`. Namely, it can handle spheres whose center
points have rational coordinates (i.e., of the type `Rat_kernel::FT`),
and whose squared radius is also rational. The `Surface_3` type is
also convertible to a `Rat_kernel::Sphere_3` object.

The `Xy_monotone_surface_3` type is the same as the nested
`Surface_3` type. The traits-class simply ignores the upper
hemisphere when it computes lower envelopes, and ignores the lower
hemisphere when it computes upper envelopes.
