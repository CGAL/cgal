The class `Triangulation_hierarchy_2` implements a triangulation augmented with
a data structure which allows fast point location queries.

The data structure is a hierarchy
of triangulations. The triangulation at the lowest level is
the original triangulation where operations and point location are to
be performed.
Then at each succeeding level, the data structure
stores a triangulation of a small random sample of the vertices
of the triangulation at the preceding level.

Point location
is done through a top-down nearest neighbor query.
The nearest neighbor query is first
performed naively in the top level triangulation.
Then, at each following level, the nearest neighbor at that level
is found through a linear walk performed from
the nearest neighbor found at the preceding level.

Because the number of vertices in each triangulation is only a small
fraction of the number of vertices of the preceding triangulation
the data structure remains small and achieves fast point location
queries on real
data. As proved in \cgalCite{d-iirdt-98}, this structure has an optimal behavior
when it is built for Delaunay triangulations.
However it can be used as well for other triangulations.


\tparam Tr may be any of the \cgal triangulation classes. The vertex of the triangulation must
           be a model of the concept `TriangulationHierarchyVertexBase_2`.

\cgalHeading{Types}

The class `Triangulation_hierarchy_2` inherits the types from its base triangulation
class `Tr`.

The class `Triangulation_hierarchy_2` offers exactly the same functionalities
as the triangulation Tr does.
Location queries are overloaded to benefit from the
data structure. Modifiers (insertion, removal, and displacement) are overloaded
to take care of updating the data structure.

Be careful that I/O operations are not overloaded.
Writing a `Triangulation_hierarchy_2` into a file
writes only the lowest level triangulation and drops the hierarchy
and reading it from a file results in a triangulation
whose efficiency will be that of an ordinary triangulation.

The class `Triangulation_hierarchy_vertex_base_2` is designed to be used as a vertex base class
of a triangulation plugged into a
`Triangulation_hierarchy_2<Tr>`.

It is
a model of the concept
`TriangulationHierarchyVertexBase_2` which refines
the concept
`TriangulationVertexBase_2`.

This class is templated by a parameter `Vb`
which is to be instantiated by a model of the concept
`TriangulationVertexBase_2`.
The class `Triangulation_hierarchy_vertex_base_2<Vb>` inherits
from the class `Vb`.
This design allows to use either the default
vertex base class or a user customized
vertex base with additional functionalities.
