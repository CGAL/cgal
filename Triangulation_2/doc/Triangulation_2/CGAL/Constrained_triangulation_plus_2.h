\ingroup PkgTriangulation2TriangulationClasses

The class `Constrained_triangulation_plus_2<Tr>`
provides a constrained triangulation with an additional data
structure
that keeps track of the input constraints and of their refinement
in the triangulation.
The class `Constrained_triangulation_plus_2<Tr>`
inherits from its template parameter Tr, which has to be instantiated
by a constrained or constrained Delaunay triangulation.
The intersection tag of the base class determines whether
intersecting input constraints are supported or not.
When intersections of input constraints are supported,
the base class constructs a triangulation of the arrangement
of the constraints,
introducing new vertices at each proper intersection
point.


The data structure maintains for each input constraint
the sequence of vertices on this constraint. These vertices are
either vertices of the input constraint or intersection points.

\todo The following description does not match the code
Two consecutive vertices of an input constraint form a *subconstraint*.
A subconstraint is a pair of vertex handles and corresponds to a constrained edge of the
triangulation, which is a pair of a face handle and an index.

The triangulation also enables the retrieval of the set
of subconstraints of the triangulation (not ordered along constraints).
It further enables the retrieval of the set of input constraints that induce a subconstraint.
As it is straightforward to obtain a subconstraint from a constrained edge `e`,
one can obtain the input constraints which induce `e`.

/*! \name Polyline Simplification
\cgalAdvancedBegin
The polyline simplification algorithm described in Chapter
\ref Chapter_2D_Polyline_simplification
operates on polyline constraints. The algorithm removes
in each simplification step
a vertex of a constraint and at the same time from the triangulation.
The class `Constrained_triangulation_plus_2` stores
for each constraint not only the sequence of vertices but
also the original sequence of points at those vertices.
As the `Vertices_in_constraint_iterator` enables the traversal of
the current set of vertices, the `Points_in_constraint_iterator`
enables the traversal of the points that were in the constraint
before the simplification algorithm started.

It enables the simplification algorithm to compute the error introduced by
each simplification step:
it is the distance of the current sequence (vertices) to the original
sequence (points).

Those stored points which do not correspond to a vertex can be removed
afterward either for a single constraint or for all constraints.

The simplification algorithm uses the following types and functions.
