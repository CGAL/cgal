\ingroup PkgTriangulation2TriangulationClasses

The class `Delaunay_triangulation_2` is designed to represent
the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in a plane.
A Delaunay triangulation of a set of points
is a triangulation of the sets of points that fulfills
the following <I>empty circle property</I>
(also called <I>Delaunay property</I>): the circumscribing
circle of any facet
of the triangulation contains no point of the set in its interior.
For a point set with no case of co-circularity
of more than three points,
the Delaunay triangulation is unique, it is the dual
of the Voronoi diagram of the points.

\tparam Tds must be a model of `TriangulationDataStructure_2`.
\cgal provides a default instantiation for this parameter,
which is the class
`CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2 < CGAL::Triangulation_vertex_base_2<Traits>, CGAL::Triangulation_face_base_2<Traits> >`.

\tparam Traits must be a model of `DelaunayTriangulationTraits_2`.
The concept `DelaunayTriangulationTraits_2` refines the
concept `TriangulationTraits_2`, providing
a predicate type to check the empty circle property.

Changing this predicate type
allows the user to build Delaunay triangulations for different metrics
such that \f$ L_1\f$ or \f$ L_{\infty}\f$ or any metric defined by a
convex object. However, the user of an exotic metric
must be careful that the constructed triangulation
has to be a triangulation of the convex hull
which means that convex hull edges have to be Delaunay edges.
This is granted for any smooth convex metric (like \f$ L_2\f$)
and can be ensured for other metrics (like \f$ L_{\infty}\f$)
by the addition to the point set of well chosen sentinel points.
The concept of `DelaunayTriangulationTraits_2` is described ::DelaunayTriangulationTraits_2.

When dealing with a large triangulations, the user is advised to
encapsulate the Delaunay triangulation class into a triangulation
hierarchy, which means to use the class
`Triangulation_hierarchy_2<Tr>` with the template parameter
instantiated with `Delaunay_triangulation_2`. The triangulation
hierarchy will then offer the same functionalities but be much more
for efficient for locations and insertions.

\cgalHeading{Types}

All the types defined in `Triangulation_2<Traits,Tds>` are inherited.

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

Insertion is implemented by inserting in the triangulation, then
performing a sequence of Delaunay flips. The number of flips is \f$ O(d)\f$
if the new vertex is of degree \f$ d\f$ in the new triangulation. For
points distributed uniformly at random, insertion takes time \f$ O(1)\f$ on
average.

Removal calls the removal in the triangulation and then re-triangulates
the hole in such a way that the Delaunay criterion is satisfied. Removal of a
vertex of degree \f$ d\f$ takes time \f$ O(d^2)\f$.
The degree \f$ d\f$ is \f$ O(1)\f$ for a random
vertex in the triangulation.

After a point location step, the nearest neighbor
is found in time \f$ O(n)\f$ in the
worst case, but in time \f$ O(1)\f$
for vertices distributed uniformly at random and any query point.
