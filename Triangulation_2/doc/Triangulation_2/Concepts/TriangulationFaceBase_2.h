\cgalConcept

The concept `TriangulationFaceBase_2` describes the requirements for
the base face class of a triangulation data structure
that is itself plugged into a basic triangulation
or a Delaunay triangulation.

This concept refines the concept `TriangulationDSFaceBase_2`
and could add geometric information. In fact,
currently the triangulations do not store any geometric information in the faces
and, thus this concept is just equal to `TriangulationDSFaceBase_2`
and only provided for symmetry with the vertex case.
