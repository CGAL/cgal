\cgalConcept

In a constrained triangulation,
the information about constrained edges is stored in the
faces of the triangulation.
The base face of a constrained triangulation
has to be a model of the concept
`ConstrainedTriangulationFaceBase_2` which refines the concept
`TriangulationFaceBase_2`
providing functionalities to deal with
constraints.

\cgalRefines `TriangulationFaceBase_2`
