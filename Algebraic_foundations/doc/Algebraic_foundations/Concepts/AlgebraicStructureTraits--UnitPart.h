This `AdaptableUnaryFunction` computes the unit part of a given ring
element.

The mathematical definition of unit part is as follows: Two ring elements \f$ a\f$
and \f$ b\f$ are said to be associate if there exists an invertible ring element
(i.e.\ a unit) \f$ u\f$ such that \f$ a = ub\f$. This defines an equivalence relation.
We can distinguish exactly one element of every equivalence class as being
unit normal. Then each element of a ring possesses a factorization into a unit
(called its unit part) and a unit-normal ring element
(called its unit normal associate).

For the integers, the non-negative numbers are by convention unit normal,
hence the unit-part of a non-zero integer is its sign. For a `Field`, every
non-zero element is a unit and is its own unit part, its unit normal
associate being one. The unit part of zero is, by convention, one.
