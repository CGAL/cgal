A model of `UniqueFactorizationDomain` is an `IntegralDomain` with the
additional property
that the ring it represents is a unique factorization domain
(a.k.a. UFD or factorial ring), meaning that every non-zero non-unit
element has a factorization into irreducible elements that is unique
up to order and up to multiplication by invertible elements (units).
(An irreducible element is a non-unit ring element that cannot be factored
further into two non-unit elements. In a UFD, the irreducible elements
are precisely the prime elements.)

In a UFD, any two elements, not both zero, possess a greatest common
divisor (gcd).

Moreover, `CGAL::Algebraic_structure_traits< UniqueFactorizationDomain >`
is a model of `AlgebraicStructureTraits` providing:

- \link AlgebraicStructureTraits::Algebraic_category `CGAL::Algebraic_structure_traits< UniqueFactorizationDomain >::Algebraic_category` \endlink
derived from `CGAL::Unique_factorization_domain_tag`
- \link AlgebraicStructureTraits::Gcd `CGAL::Algebraic_structure_traits< UniqueFactorizationDomain >::Gcd` \endlink  which is a model of `AlgebraicStructureTraits_::Gcd`
