\begin{ccRefConcept}{Field}


\ccDefinition

A model of \ccc{Field} is an IntegralDomain in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. 
Thus, one can divide by any non-zero element. Hence division is defined for any divisor != 0. 
For a Field, we require this division operation to be available through operators / and /=.

Moreover, \ccc{CGAL::Algebraic_structure_traits< Field >} is a model of \ccc{AlgebraicStructureTraits} providing:\\
- \ccc{CGAL::Algebraic_structure_traits< Field >::Algebraic_type} derived from \ccc{Field_tag} \\

\ccHeading{Remarks:}
Most ring-theoretic notions like greatest common divisors become trivial for fields. 
Hence we see Field as a refinement of IntegralDomain and not as a refinement of one of the more advanced 
types of ring. If an algorithm wants to rely on gcd or remainder computation, it is trying to do things 
it shouldn't do with a field in the first place.
