\section{Real Number Types}
Every CGAL \ccc{Kernel} comes with two \emph{real number types}
(number types embeddable into the real numbers). One of them is a
\ccc{FieldNumberType}, and the other a \ccc{RingNumberType}.  The
coordinates of the basic kernel objects (points, vectors, etc.) come
from one of these types (the \ccc{FieldNumberType} in case of Cartesian
kernels, and the \ccc{RingNumberType} for Homogeneous kernels). 

The concept \ccc{FieldNumberType} combines the requirements of the
concepts \ccc{Field} and \ccc{RealEmbeddable}, while
\ccc{RingNumberType} combines \ccc{IntegralDomainWithoutDivision} and
\ccc{RealEmbeddable}. Algebraically, the real number types do not form
distinct structures and are therefore not listed in the concept
hierarchy of Figure~\ref{fig::ConceptHierarchyOfAlgebraicStructures}.
