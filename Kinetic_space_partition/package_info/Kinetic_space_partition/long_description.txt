Kinetic Shape Partition

This CGAL package provides a way to partition 2D or 3D space by propagating
2D segments or 3D polygons until they intersect the predefined number of times.
Once the partition is found, a 3D shape can be reconstructed by utilizing a graph cut approach.
The final result is a piece-wise linear approximation of the given smooth shape.
