/*! \brief The ManipulatedCameraFrame class represents a ManipulatedFrame with
  Camera specific mouse bindings. \class ManipulatedCameraFrame
  manipulatedCameraFrame.h CGAL::QGLViewer/manipulatedCameraFrame.h

  A ManipulatedCameraFrame is a specialization of a ManipulatedFrame, designed
  to be set as the Camera::frame(). Mouse motions are basically interpreted in a
  negated way: when the mouse goes to the right, the ManipulatedFrame
  translation goes to the right, while the ManipulatedCameraFrame has to go to
  the \e left, so that the \e scene seems to move to the right.

  A ManipulatedCameraFrame rotates around its pivotPoint(), which corresponds to
  the associated Camera::pivotPoint().

  A ManipulatedCameraFrame can also "fly" in the scene. It basically moves
  forward, and turns according to the mouse motion. See flySpeed(),
  sceneUpVector() and the MOVE_FORWARD and MOVE_BACKWARD
  MouseAction.

  See the <a href="../mouse.html">mouse page</a> for a description of the
  possible actions that can be performed using the mouse and their bindings.

  /*! Returns \c true when the frame's rotation is constrained around the
     sceneUpVector(), and \c false otherwise, when the rotation is completely
     free (default).

          In free mode, the associated camera can be arbitrarily rotated in the
     scene, along its three axis, thus possibly leading to any arbitrary
     orientation.

          When you setRotatesAroundUpVector() to \c true, the sceneUpVector()
     defines a 'vertical' direction around which the camera rotates. The camera
     can rotate left or right, around this axis. It can also be moved up or down
     to show the 'top' and 'bottom' views of the scene. As a result, the
     sceneUpVector() will always appear vertical in the scene, and the horizon
     is preserved and stays projected along the camera's horizontal axis.

          Note that setting this value to \c true when the sceneUpVector() is
     not already vertically projected will break these invariants. It will also
     limit the possible movement of the camera, possibly up to a lock when the
     sceneUpVector() is projected horizontally. Use Camera::setUpVector() to
     define the sceneUpVector() and align the camera before calling this method
     to ensure this does not happen. */

    When set to \c false (default), a zoom action will move the camera along its
    Camera::viewDirection(), i.e. back and forth along a direction perpendicular
    to the projection screen.

    setZoomsOnPivotPoint() to \c true will move the camera along an axis defined
    by the Camera::pivotPoint() and its current position instead. As a result,
    the projected position of the pivot point on screen will stay the same
    during a zoom. */
