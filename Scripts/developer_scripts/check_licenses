# This script can be used to check all files in an internal or external release
# for proper license notices. It reports all files without a proper notice.
# Observe that the check is fairly simple, we just grep through the files
# looking for a fixed string. Additionally, there might be provisions in the
# top-level LICENSE file that are not taken into account by this script.

# Note that there might be license errors that are not detected by this script.
# For example, we do not check that files under LGPL and QPL are not mixed in
# one library.
