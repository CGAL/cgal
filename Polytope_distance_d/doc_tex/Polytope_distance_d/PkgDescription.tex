\ccPkgSummary{
This package provides algorithms for computing the distance between the
convex hulls of two point sets in d-dimensional space, without
explicitely constructing the convex hulls.   It further provides
an algorithm to compute the width of a point set, and the furthest
point for each vertex of a convex polygon.
