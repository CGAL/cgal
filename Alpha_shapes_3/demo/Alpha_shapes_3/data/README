The purpose of this repository is to make some range data
and detailed reconstructions available to the public. Currently, this repository only contains models that were scanned and reconstructed
at the Stanford Computer Graphics Laboratory . In the future, we hope to include data sets and reconstructions from other sources. 

The models in this repository were all scanned with a Cyberware 3030MS optical triangulation scanner.
