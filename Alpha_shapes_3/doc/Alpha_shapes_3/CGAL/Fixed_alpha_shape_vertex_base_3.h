The class `Fixed_alpha_shape_vertex_base_3` is the default model for the concept
`FixedAlphaShapeVertex_3`.

\tparam Traits is the geometric traits class that is provided
to the `Alpha_shape_3` class.
\tparam Vb must be a vertex base class adapted to the type of triangulation that is being used.
        By default, it is instantiated with `Triangulation_vertex_base_3<Traits>`,
        which is appropriate for basic alpha shapes.
