\ingroup PkgAlphaShapes3Ref

The class `Alpha_shape_3` represents the family of
alpha shapes of points in the 3D space for <I>all</I> real
\f$ \alpha\f$. It maintains an underlying triangulation
of the class `Dt`. Each k-dimensional face of Dt is associated with an
interval that specifies for which values of alpha the face belongs to the alpha shape.

Note that this class is used for <I>basic</I>, <I>weighted</I>,
and <I>periodic</I> Alpha Shapes.

The modifying functions `insert` and `remove` will overwrite
the one inherited from the underlying triangulation class `Dt`.
At the moment, only the static version is implemented.

\tparam Dt must be either `Delaunay_triangulation_3`, `Regular_triangulation_3`,
`Periodic_3_Delaunay_triangulation_3` or `Periodic_3_regular_triangulation_3`.
Note that `Dt::Geom_traits`, `Dt::Vertex`, and `Dt::Face`
must be model the concepts `AlphaShapeTraits_3`,
`AlphaShapeVertex_3` and `AlphaShapeCell_3`, respectively.

\tparam The second template parameter `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is a tag that, when set to
\link Tag_true `Tag_true`\endlink, triggers exact comparisons between alpha values. This is useful
when the Delaunay triangulation is instantiated with an exact predicates inexact constructions
kernel. By default the `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is set to \link Tag_false `Tag_false`\endlink as it induces a small
overhead. Note that the tag `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is currently ignored (meaning that the code will
 behave as if `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` were set to \link Tag_false `Tag_false`\endlink)
if `Dt::Geom_traits::FT` is not a floating point number type as this strategy
does not make sense if the traits class already provides exact constructions.

\warning
<ul>
<li>When the tag `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is set to \link Tag_true `Tag_true`\endlink,
the class `Cartesian_converter` is used internally to switch between the traits class
and the \cgal kernel `CGAL::Simple_cartesian<NT>`, where `NT` can be either `CGAL::Interval_nt` or
`CGAL::Exact_rational`. `Cartesian_converter` must thus offer the necessary functors
to convert a three-dimensional point of the traits class to a three-dimensional point
of `CGAL::Simple_cartesian<NT>`. However, these functors are not necessarily provided by
the basic `Cartesian_converter`, for example when a custom point is used.
In this case, a partial specialization of `Cartesian_converter`
must be provided by the user. An example of such specialization is given in the
two-dimensional Alpha Shapes example \ref Alpha_shapes_2/ex_alpha_projection_traits.cpp "ex_alpha_projection_traits.cpp".
<li>The tag `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` cannot be used in conjonction with periodic triangulations.
When the tag `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is set to \link Tag_true `Tag_true`\endlink,
the evaluations of predicates such as `Side_of_oriented_sphere_3` are done lazily.
Consequently, the predicates store pointers to the geometrical positions of the
points passed as arguments of the predicates. It is thus important that
these points are not temporary objects. Points of the triangulation are accessed
using the function `point(Cell_handle, int)` of the underlying triangulation.
In the case of periodic triangulations, the `point(Cell_handle, int)` function
is actually a construction that returns a temporary, which thus cannot be used
along with a lazy predicate evaluation.
</ul>

\cgalHeading{I/O}
The I/O operators are defined for `iostream`, and for
the window stream provided by \cgal. The format for the iostream
is an internal format.

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

In `GENERAL` mode, the alpha intervals of each triangulation
face is computed and stored at initialization time.
In `REGULARIZED` mode, the alpha shape intervals of edges
are not stored nor computed at initialization.
Edges are simply classified on the fly upon request.
This allows to have much faster building of alpha shapes in
`REGULARIZED` mode.

Function `Alpha_shape_3::alpha_find()` uses linear search, while
`Alpha_shape_3::alpha_lower_bound()` and `Alpha_shape_3::alpha_upper_bound()`
use binary search.
`Alpha_shape_3::number_of_solid_components()` performs a graph traversal and takes time
linear in the number of cells of the underlying triangulation.
`Alpha_shape_3::find_optimal_alpha()` uses binary search and takes time
\f$ O(n \log n)\f$, where \f$ n\f$ is the number of points.

In case `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is `CGAL::Tag_false`, it is Gt::FT.

In case `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is `CGAL::Tag_true`, it is a number type
allowing filtered exact comparisons (that is, interval arithmetic is first used before
resorting to exact arithmetic). Access to the interval containing the exact value is provided through the function
`FT::Approximate_nt approx() const` where `FT::Approximate_nt` is `Interval_nt<Protected>`
with `Protected=true`. Access to the exact value is provided through the function
`FT::Exact_nt exact() const` where `FT::Exact_nt` depends on the configuration of \cgal
(it may be `mpq_class`, `Gmpq`, `Quotient<CGAL::MP_Float>`, etc).
An overload for the function `double to_double(FT)` is also available. Its
precision is controlled through `FT::set_relative_precision_of_to_double()` in
exactly the same way as with `Lazy_exact_nt<NT>`, so a call to `to_double` may
trigger an exact evaluation.
It must be noted that an object of type `FT` is valid as long as the alpha shapes class that creates
it is valid and has not been modified.
For convenience, classical comparison operators are provided for the type `FT`.
