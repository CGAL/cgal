\section{Release Note}

Beginning with \cgal\ R2.3, this package has been replaced with a new
design.  The old files are still available for backwards compatibility
and to support older compiler, such as MSVC++6.0. However their use is
deprecated and the manual page are not converted into the new
reference manual format. Instead they are collected in this manual
here. See the regular user and reference manual for the new design.
The two designs are not interchangeable.

\section{Introduction}

A halfedge data structure is an edge-centered data structure capable
of maintaining incidence informations of vertices, edges and facets,
for example for planar maps, polyhedra, or other orientable,
two-dimensional surfaces embedded in arbitrary dimension. Each edge is
decomposed into two halfedges with opposite orientations. One incident
facet and one incident vertex are stored in each halfedge.  For each
facet and each vertex one incident halfedge is stored.  Reduced
variants of the halfedge data structure can omit some of these
informations, for example the halfedge pointers in vertices or the
storage of vertices at all.

The data structure provided here is known as the
FE-structure~\cite{w-ebdss-85}, as
halfedges~\cite{m-ism-88,bfh-mgedm-95} or as the doubly connected edge
list (DCEL)~\cite{bkos-cgaa-97}, although the original reference for
the DCEL~\cite{mp-fitcp-78} describes a different data structure. We
continue naming it halfedge data structure (HDS). This data structure
can also be seen as one of the variants of the quad-edge data
structure~\cite{gs-pmgsc-85}, reduced to support only orientable
surfaces. In general, the quad-edge data structure has a richer
modeling space and can represent non-orientable 2-manifolds. The dual
and the primal graph are symmetrically represented; the same
algorithms can be applied to the dual graph as well as to the primal
graph. This implies a lack of static type checking to distinguish
between facets and vertices.  Even though halfedges are similar to the
winged edge data structure~\cite{b-prcv-75} or the original reference
for the DCEL~\cite{mp-fitcp-78}, they are not equivalent, since the
traversal algorithms are forced to search for certain incidences where
the information is directly available in the halfedge data structure.
An overview and comparison of these different data structures together
with a thorough description of the design implemented here can be
found in~\cite{k-ddsps-98}.


\subsection*{Design Overview}

The design strictly separates topology and geometry. Vertices,
halfedges and facets carry both kinds of information. The
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} acts as a container class and stores all
items and manages their incidence relations. For example the
\ccc{Polyhedron} from Chapter~\ref{chapterPolyhedron} uses the
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} and adds geometric operations. It
imposes further restrictions on the data structure, for example, that
an edge always has two distinct endpoints.

offers a closer look at the design using \ccc{Polyhedron} as example.
Note that \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure}, \ccc{Vertex_base}, \ccc{Halfedge_base}
and \ccc{Facet_base} are concepts, where each can have multiple
models. There are many different possibilities for vertices, edges and
facets. Currently, two different models are provided for the
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure}. Many combinations are possible and
result in a different \ccc{Polyhedron}.  We make use of the
implicit instantiation of template classes in \CC.  The requirement
set for a model consists of a mandatory part that every model must
comply with and certain optional parts a model must only comply with
if the corresponding functionality is actually used. For example, a
vertex is allowed to be empty. If we want to use it for the polyhedral
surface, then the normal vector computation imposes the additional
requirements that the vertex must contain a three-dimensional point
and gives access to it with the member function \ccc{point()}.

The responsibilities of the base classes for vertices, halfedges and
facets are the actual storage of the incidences in terms of
\ccc{void}-pointers, the geometry and other attributes. Especially the
storage of incidences with \ccc{void}-pointers allows, for example,
the facet class to be exchanged without rewriting the halfedge class.
The advantage of strong type checking will be reestablished in the
next layer.  Implementations for vertices, edges and facets are
provided that fulfill the minimal set of requirements. They can be
used as base classes for own extensions.  Richer implementations are
provided as defaults; for polyhedra they provide a three-dimensional
point in the vertices and a plane equation in the facets.

The \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} is responsible for the storage
organization of the vertices, halfedges and facets. Currently,
implementations are provided that use a bidirectional list or an \stl\ 
\ccc{std::vector} internally. The \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} derives new
classes for vertices, halfedges and facets. They replace the
\ccc{void}-pointer incidence information with type-safe pointers at
the interface. Additional information besides the incidence
information simply stays unaffected and will be inherited.

Different models are possible for the \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure}
(two are available right now).  Thus the set of requirements for the
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} is kept small. To support the
implementation of high-level operations, a helper class
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure_decorator} is provided, which is not
shown in Figure~\ccTexHtml{\ref{figurePolyDesign}}{}\begin{ccHtmlOnly}
  <A HREF="Chapter_hds.html#figurePolyDesign"><IMG 
  SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A>
\end{ccHtmlOnly}
 but would be placed at the side
of the \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure}, since it broadens that interface
but does not hide it. It adds Euler operations and adaptive
functionality.  For example, if the \ccc{prev()} function is not
provided for halfedges, a \ccc{find_prev()} function searches the
previous halfedge along the facet. If the \ccc{prev()} function is 
available, the \ccc{find_prev()} function simply calls it. This
distinction is resolved at compile time with a technique called {\em
  compile-time tags}, similar to iterator tags in~\cite{sl-stl-95}.

The \ccc{Polyhedron} (Chapter~\ref{chapterPolyhedron}) adds an 
ease-of-use layer in terms of high-level
functions, high-level concepts for accessing the items, i.e.~handles,
iterators and circulators (pointers are no longer visible at this
interface), and the protection of the combinatorial integrity. It
derives new vertices, halfedges and facets to provide the handles and
hide the pointers.

\subsection*{Organization of this Chapter}

Section~\ref{sectionHds} describes the requirements a
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} with its three local classes for
vertices, halfedges and facets must fulfill.
Section~\ref{sectionHdsModels} names the models currently available.
These models make use of the \ccc{Vertex_base}, \ccc{Halfedge_base}
and \ccc{Facet_base} concepts, whose requirements are stated in
Section~\ref{sectionHdsBases}. The predefined base classes are
described in Section~\ref{sectionHdsBasesModels}. The helper class
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure_decorator} follows in
Section~\ref{sectionHdsDecorator}. Several examples of halfedge data
structures in Section~\ref{sectionHdsExamples} conclude the chapter.

\ccHeading{Operations with Border Halfedges}

\begin{ccAdvanced}
  
The following notion of border halfedges is particularly useful
where the halfedge data structure is used to model surfaces with a
border. The halfedge data structure does not support holes within a
facet, but the surface can have open regions. Halfedges at the border
of the surface are called {\em border halfedges}. A halfedge is a {\em
  border edge\/} if the halfedge itself or its opposite halfedge are
border halfedges. The only requirement to work with border halfedges
is that the \ccc{Halfedge} class provides a member function
\ccc{is_border()} returning a \ccc{bool}. Usually, the halfedge data
structure supports facets and a \ccc{NULL} facet pointer will indicate
a border halfedge, but this is not the only possibility.  The
\ccc{is_border()} predicate divides the edges into two classes, the
border edges and the non-border edges. The following normalization
reorganizes the sequential storage of the edges such that the
non-border edges precede the border edges, and that for each border
edge the latter of the two halfedges is a border halfedge (the first
one might be a border halfedge too). The normalization stores the
number of border halfedges, as well as the halfedge iterator where the
border edges start at, within the halfedge data structure.  Halfedge
insertion or removal and changing the border status of a halfedge may
invalidate these values, which are not automatically updated.

\ccThree{Halfedge_iterator}{hds.size_of;}{}

\ccMethod{void   normalize_border();}
    {sorts halfedges such that the non-border edges precede the
     border edges. For each border edge that is incident to a facet,
     the halfedge iterator will reference the halfedge incident to the
     facet right before the halfedge that is not incident to a facet.}

    {number of border halfedges. An edge with no incident facet
      counts as two border halfedges.

\ccMethod{Size size_of_border_edges() const;}
    {number of border edges. If \ccc{size_of_border_edges()} is equal

    a facet on one side and to no facet on the other side.

\section{Models of \protect\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure}}
% +========================================================================+
\label{sectionHdsModels}

Four models are currently provided for the
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} concept in \cgal. Two generic models are
parameterized with models of the \ccc{Vertex_base},
\ccc{Halfedge_base} and \ccc{Facet_base} concepts:
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure_using_list} manages the items with a
doubly-linked list, and \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure_using_vector}
manages the items internally with an \stl\ \ccc{std::vector}. Two
further models provide default solutions based on the generic model
using lists. The model \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure_default}
implements all incidences and allows to choose a point type for
vertices.  \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure_polyhedron_default_3} is
prepared for polyhedral surfaces. It implements again all incidences
and stores a three-dimensional point in vertices and a plane equation
in facets, see Section~\ref{sectionPolyHdsDefault} for details.


% +-------------------------------------------------------------+
\begin{ccClassTemplate}{Halfedge_data_structure_default<Point>}
\subsection{The Default Halfedge Data Structure}
\label{sectionHdsDefault}

\ccCreationVariable{hds}

\ccDefinition

The default \ccClassTemplateName\ implements all incidences supported
by the \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} concept. It stores a point of
type \ccc{Point} in each vertex.

\ccInclude{CGAL/Halfedge_data_structure_default.h}

\ccImplementation

The default halfedge data structure is a wrapper for
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure_using_list} instantiated with
\ccc{Vertex_max_base<Point>}, \ccc{Halfedge_max_base} and
\ccc{Facet_max_base}, see Section~\ref{sectionHdsUsingList} to
\ref{sectionHdsBasesModels}. Note that the copy constructor
and the assignment operator are suboptimal for the list representation.

\end{ccClassTemplate}



% +-------------------------------------------------------------+
\begin{ccClassTemplate}{Halfedge_data_structure_using_list<V,H,F>}
\subsection{A Halfedge Data Structure Using Lists}
\label{sectionHdsUsingList}

\ccDefinition

\ccClassTemplateName\ is a model of the \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure}
concept. It is parameterized with a model $V$ of the \ccc{Vertex_base}
concept, a model $H$ of the \ccc{Halfedge_base} concept, and a model
$F$ of the \ccc{Facet_base} concept, whose requirements can be found
in Section~\ref{sectionHdsBases}.  Predefined models can be found in
Section~\ref{sectionHdsBasesModels}.

\ccClassTemplateName\ uses doubly-linked lists to store the items.
This implies bidirectional iterators to access the elements and
support for random insertions and deletions. It adds internally two
additional pointers to each element.  The capacity is not influenced
by calls to \ccc{reserve()} and calling \ccc{reserve()} do not
invalidate any iterator or circulator.

\ccInclude{CGAL/Halfedge_data_structure_using_list.h}

\ccTypes

It supports all types required for the \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} concept,
specifically the following two types are fixed.

\ccThree{typedef random_access_iterator_tag;;}{Supports_removal;}{}
\ccTypedef{typedef Tag_true Supports_removal;}{}
\ccGlue
\ccTypedef{typedef bidirectional_iterator_tag iterator_category;}{}

\ccOperations

\ccClassTemplateName\ complies to the requirements stated for the
concept \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} in Section~\ref{sectionHds}.

\ccImplementation

It uses \ccc{In_place_list} to implement the internal list
storage, see the \cgal\ support library manual. The copy constructor
and the assignment operator must update all internal pointers, which
is currently done using the \stl\ map, thus resulting in a runtime of
$O( |V| \log |V| + |H| \log |H| + |F| \log |F|)$ instead of optimal
linear time.

\end{ccClassTemplate}


% +-------------------------------------------------------------+
\begin{ccClassTemplate}{Halfedge_data_structure_using_vector<V,H,F>}

\subsection{A Halfedge Data Structure Using Vectors}
\label{sectionHdsUsingVector}

\ccDefinition

\ccClassTemplateName\ is a model of the \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure}
concept. It is parameterized with a model $V$ of the \ccc{Vertex_base}
concept, a model $H$ of the \ccc{Halfedge_base} concept, and a model
$F$ of the \ccc{Facet_base} concept, whose requirements can be found
in Section~\ref{sectionHdsBases}.  Predefined models can be found in
Section~\ref{sectionHdsBasesModels}.

\ccClassTemplateName\ uses an \stl\ \ccc{std::vector} to store the
elements. This implies random access iterators to access the elements,
but no support for random insertions and deletions. The capacity is
restricted to the reserved size. Allocations are not possible beyond
the capacity without calling reserve again. All pointers, iterators
and circulators are invalidated upon a reserve call that increases the
capacity. (This restriction might be dropped in the future and the
polyhedron will automatically reallocate if the capacity exceeds.)

\ccInclude{CGAL/Halfedge_data_structure_using_vector.h}

\ccTypes

It supports all types required for the \ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} concept,
specifically the following two types are fixed.

\ccThree{typedef random_access_iterator_tag;;}{Supports_removal;}{}
\ccTypedef{typedef Tag_false Supports_removal;}{}
\ccGlue
\ccTypedef{typedef random_access_iterator_tag iterator_category;}{}

\ccOperations

\ccClassTemplateName\ complies to the requirements for the concept
\ccc{Halfedge_data_structure} as stated in
Section~\ref{sectionHds}.

\ccImplementation

It uses \stl\ \ccc{std::vector} to implement the internal storage.

\ccHeading{Modifying Functions (Euler Operators)}

\ccThree{Halfedge*}{hds.split_f}{}

The following Euler operations modify consistently the combinatorial
structure of the halfedge data structure. The geometry remains unchanged.
Note that well known graph operations are also captured with these 
Euler operators, for example an edge contraction is equal to an
\ccc{join_vertex()} operation, or an edge removal to \ccc{join_facet()}.

Given a halfedge data structure \ccc{hds} and a halfedge pointer $h$
four special applications of the Euler operators are:
\ccc{split_vertex(h,h)} results in an antenna emanating from the tip
of \ccc{h}.
\ccc{split_vertex(h,h->next()->opposite())} results in an edge split
of the halfedge \ccc{h->next} with a new vertex in-between.
\ccc{split_facet(h,h)} results in a loop directly following \ccc{h}.
\ccc{split_facet(h,h->next())} results in a bridge parallel to
the halfedge \ccc{h->next} with a new facet in-between.

    is equal to $v$. The halfedges around $v$ starting with the
    incident halfedge of $v$ form a cycle.  For all facets $f$: the
    incident facet of the incident halfedge of $f$ is equal to $f$.
    The halfedges around $f$ starting with the incident halfedge of
    $f$ form a cycle.  Some checks that redundancies among internal
    variables holds, e.g. that the iterators enumerate as many items
    as the related size value indicates.

    {\em Level 1:} All tests of level 0. For all halfedges $h$: The
    incident vertex of $h$ is equal to the incident vertex of the
    opposite of the next halfedge. The incident facet of $h$ is equal
    to the incident facet of the next halfedge.
    \\[6pt]
    {\em Level 2:} All tests of level 1. The sum of all halfedges that
    can be reached through the vertices must be equal to the number of
    all halfedges, i.e.~all halfedges incident to a vertex must form a
    single cycle.

    all halfedges, i.e.~all halfedges surrounding a facet must form a

\section{Examples of Halfedge Data Structures}
% +========================================================================+
\label{sectionHdsExamples}


% +-------------------------------------------------------------+
\subsection{The Default Halfedge Data Structure}

The default halfedge data structure from
Section~\ref{sectionHdsDefault} expects a point as template argument,
which we choose to be an {\tt int} for simplicity. The example program
defines a halfedge data structure and a decorator, see
Section~\ref{sectionHdsDecorator} for the decorator. The program
creates a loop, consisting of two halfedges, one vertex and two
facets, and checks its validity.

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Halfedge_DS/hds_prog_default.C}


% +-------------------------------------------------------------+
\subsection{A Minimal Halfedge Data Structure}

The following program declares a minimal structure {\tt HDS} using the
minimal bases provided in Section~\ref{sectionHdsBasesModels} and a
list-bases halfedge data structure from
Section~\ref{sectionHdsUsingList}. The result is a data structure
maintaining only halfedges with next and opposite pointers.  No
vertices or facets are stored. The data structure models an {\em
  undirected graph}.

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Halfedge_DS/hds_prog_graph.C}


% +-------------------------------------------------------------+
\subsection{The Default with a Vector Instead of a List}

The default halfedge data structure uses a list internally and the
maximal base classes. Assuming we have a point type {\tt Point} we can
declare an alternative data structure {\tt HDS} using the same base
classes but the vector storage from Section~\ref{sectionHdsUsingVector}.
Note that for the vector storage the size of the halfedge data
structure must be reserved beforehand, either with the constructor as
shown in the example or with the {\tt reserve()} member function.

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Halfedge_DS/hds_prog_vector.C}


% +-------------------------------------------------------------+
\subsection{Example Adding Color to Facets}

This example re-uses the base class available for facets and adds
another member variable \ccc{color}. The facet in the halfedge data
structure and data structures building upon that will inherit 
the new member variable, as the main function indicates. The same can
be done with any kind of functionality and any of the three items;
vertices, halfedges or facets. However, note that additional pointers
to vertices, halfedges, and facets cannot be introduced this way,
since they are only maintained as {\tt void*} pointers at this
level. The internal classes, which are responsible for the type safe
pointers, must be extended to achieve this.

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Halfedge_DS/hds_prog_color.C}


% +-------------------------------------------------------------+
\subsection{Example Extending the Minimal Halfedge Base with a
  Previous Pointer}

The minimal halfedge data structure above can be extended to a data
structure also supporting a previous pointer for halfedges. We replace
the \ccc{Halfedge_min_base} with our own \ccc{Halfedge_base}
derived from the \ccc{Halfedge_min_base}.

\begin{verbatim}
  class My_halfedge : public Halfedge_min_base {
      void* prv;
  public:
      typedef  Tag_true   Supports_halfedge_prev;
      void*       prev()                    { return prv;}
      const void* prev() const              { return prv;}
      void        set_prev( void* h)        { prv = h;}
  };  
\end{verbatim}

% +-------------------------------------------------------------+
\subsection{Example Using own Halfedge Structure}

\begin{ccAdvanced}
  
The halfedge data structure as presented here is not as space efficient as
for example the winged
edge data structure~\cite{b-prcv-75}, the DCEL~\cite{mp-fitcp-78} or
variants of the quad-edge data structure~\cite{gs-pmgsc-85}.
On the other side they do not need any search operations during
traversals. A comparison can be found in~\cite{k-ddsps-98}.

Computation time versus memory space can also be traded with the
halfedge data structure design as presented here.  We will use
traditional C techniques like type casting and make the assumption
that pointers (especially those from {\tt malloc} or {\tt new}) points
to even addresses. The idea is as follows: The halfedge data structure
allocate halfedges pairwise.  Concerning the vector based data
structure this implies that the absolute value of the difference
between a halfedge and its opposite halfedge is always one with
respect to C pointer arithmetic. We can replace the opposite pointer
by a single bit coding the sign of this difference.  We will store
this bit as the least significant bit together with the next halfedge
pointer.  The example also omits the previous pointer. What remains
are three pointers per halfedge. The same solution can be applied to
the list based polyhedron traits class with the difference that the
{\tt SIZE} constant must reflect the additional pointers needed for
the list management. They are added internally of the halfedge data
structure using the base class \ccc{In_place_list_base<My_halfedge>}.


\ccIncludeExampleCode{Halfedge_DS/hds_prog_compact.C}

\end{ccAdvanced}

% +-------------------------------------------------------------+
\subsection{Example Using the Halfedge Iterator}

Three edges are created in the default halfedge data structure.
The halfedge iterator is used to count the halfedges.

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Halfedge_DS/hds_prog_halfedge_iterator.C}

% +-------------------------------------------------------------+
\subsection{Example for an Adaptor to Build an Edge Iterator}

Three edges are created in the default halfedge data structure.
The adaptor {\tt N\_step\_adaptor} is used to declare an edge
iterator, which is used to count the edges.
