  add_reference()
  remove_reference()

  The Handle_for does not know anymore, where and how the counting takes
  places. However, it assumes that count is initialized to 1 in default 
  and copy constructor.

  One level of indirection has been removed.
  The code now assumes that dynamic_cast<> is supported.

  typedef PointH2<FT,RT>               Point_2_base;
  typedef CGAL::Point_2< R >           Point_2;

    template <class rt, class ft = Quotient<rt> >
    #else
    template <class rt>
