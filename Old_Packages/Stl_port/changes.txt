1.33 (19/7/01)
Made the conversion operator to vector_const_iterator in the vector_iterator
class const. (GJG)

1.1 (12/2/01)
moved vc7/ to include/compilers/

1.0 (7/2/01)
added support for VC7.0 beta1 native STL
removed stlport/sc5, stlport/bc50, stlport/old_hp.

0.6.1 (08/12/00)
a bit more cleanup in cgal_vector.h

0.6   (08/12/00)
changed cgal_vector.h to use __STLPORT_STD:: prefix instead of std::
prefix. This is mostly for consistensy with the rest of stlport/
contents. (pointed out by S.Pashkov on the cgal-discuss mailing list)

0.5   (05/07/00)
fixed reverse_iterator oddity repoted by M.Seel

0.4.1 (03/01/00)
added
 #define CGAL_LIMITED_ITERATOR_TRAITS_SUPPORT 1
to config/stl_msvc.h
(thus eliminating the need for this setting elsewhere)

0.4 (11/10/99)
introduced new vector class by Geert-Jan;
affected original files:
stl_hashtable.h
stl_uninitialized.h
stl_vector.[ch]

0.3.1 (15/9/99)
set __STL_NO_EXCEPTIONS on in stl_user_config.h

0.3 (11/9/99)
added _STL_DEBUG handling in stl_numeric.h;
fixed stl_bitset to handle partial specialization
properly.
Fixed the stlport testsuite for our purposes
(new style headers) and run the tests on the package.
All of them now pass.
TODO: get rid of the headers that we don't need
      (old_hp/, etc)

0.2.1 (8/9/99)
changed the mode to use new style I/O headers
in stl_user_config.h

0.2 (3/9/99)
patched 
	stl_hash_map.h
	stl_hash_set.h
	stl_slist.h
	stl_rope.h
added support for pointers and pointers to pointers
for many built-in types.
*done (11/9/99) TODO: make stl_bitset* pass the test in stlport tests
