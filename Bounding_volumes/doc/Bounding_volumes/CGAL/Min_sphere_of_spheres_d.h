An object of the class `Min_sphere_of_spheres_d` is a data structure that represents
the unique sphere of smallest volume enclosing a finite set of spheres
in \f$ d\f$-dimensional Euclidean space \f$ \E^d\f$. For a set \f$ S\f$ of spheres
we denote by \f$ ms(S)\f$ the smallest sphere that contains all spheres of
\f$ S\f$; we call \f$ ms(S)\f$ the <I>minsphere</I> of \f$ S\f$. \f$ ms(S)\f$ can be
degenerate, i.e., \f$ ms(S)=\emptyset\f$,
if \f$ S=\emptyset\f$ and \f$ ms(S)=\{s\}\f$,
if \f$ S=\{s\}\f$. Any sphere in \f$ S\f$ may be degenerate, too, i.e., any
sphere from \f$ S\f$ may be a point. Also, \f$ S\f$ may contain several
copies of the same sphere.

An inclusion-minimal subset \f$ R\f$ of \f$ S\f$ with \f$ ms(R)=ms(S)\f$ is called a
<I>support set</I> for \f$ ms(S)\f$; the spheres in \f$ R\f$ are the
<I>support spheres</I>. A support set has size at most \f$ d+1\f$, and all
its spheres lie on the boundary of \f$ ms(S)\f$. (A sphere \f$ s'\f$ is said to
<I>lie on the boundary</I> of a sphere \f$ s\f$, if \f$ s'\f$ is contained in \f$ s\f$
and if their boundaries intersect.) In general, the support set is
not unique.

The algorithm computes the center and the radius of \f$ ms(S)\f$, and finds
a support set \f$ R\f$ (which remains fixed until the next `insert()`,
`clear()` or `set()` operation). We also provide a
specialization of the algorithm for the case when the center
coordinates and radii of the input spheres are floating-point numbers.
This specialized algorithm uses floating-point arithmetic only, is
very fast and especially tuned for stability and robustness. Still,
it's output may be incorrect in some (rare) cases; termination is
guaranteed.

When default constructed, an instance of type
`Min_sphere_of_spheres_d<Traits>` represents the set
\f$ S=\emptyset\f$, together with its minsphere \f$ ms(S)=\emptyset\f$. You can
add spheres to the set \f$ S\f$ by calling `insert()`. Querying the
minsphere is done by calling the routines `is_empty()`,
`radius()` and `center_cartesian_begin()`, among others.

In general, the radius and the Euclidean center coordinates of \f$ ms(S)\f$
need not be rational. Consequently, the algorithm computing the exact
minsphere will have to deal with algebraic numbers. Fortunately, both
the radius and the coordinates of the minsphere are numbers of the
form \f$ a_i+b_i\sqrt{t}\f$, where \f$ a_i,b_i,t\in \Q\f$ and where \f$ t\ge 0\f$ is
the same for all coordinates and the radius. Thus, the exact
minsphere can be described by the number \f$ t\f$, which is called the
sphere's <I>discriminant</I>, and by \f$ d+1\f$ pairs \f$ (a_i,b_i)\in\Q^2\f$
(one for the radius and \f$ d\f$ for the center coordinates).

\note This class (almost) replaces
`CGAL::Min_sphere_d<Traits>`, which solves the less general
problem of finding the smallest enclosing ball of a set of
<I>points</I>. `Min_sphere_of_spheres_d` is faster than
`CGAL::Min_sphere_d<Traits>`, and in contrast to the latter
provides a specialized implementation for floating-point arithmetic
which ensures correct results in a large number of cases (including
highly degenerate ones). The only advantage of
`CGAL::Min_sphere_d<Traits>` over `Min_sphere_of_spheres_d` is that the former
can deal with points in homogeneous coordinates, in which case the
algorithm is division-free. Thus, `CGAL::Min_sphere_d<Traits>`
might still be an option in case your input number type cannot
(efficiently) divide.

\tparam Traits must be a model of the concept
`MinSphereOfSpheresTraits` as its template argument.

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

We implement two algorithms, the LP-algorithm and a
heuristic \cgalCite{msw-sblp-92}. As described in the documentation of
concept `MinSphereOfSpheresTraits`, each has its advantages and
disadvantages: Our implementation of the LP-algorithm has maximal
expected running time \f$ O(2^d n)\f$, while the heuristic comes without
any complexity guarantee. In particular, the LP-algorithm runs in
linear time for fixed dimension \f$ d\f$. (These running times hold for the
arithmetic model, so they count the number of operations on
the number type `FT`.)

On the other hand, the LP-algorithm is, for inexact number types
`FT`, much worse at handling degeneracies and should therefore not
be used in such a case. (For exact number types
`FT`, both methods handle all kinds of degeneracies.)

Currently, we require `Traits::FT` to be either an exact number
type or `double` or `float`; other inexact number types are
not supported at this time. Also, the current implementation only
handles spheres with Cartesian coordinates; homogenous representation
is not supported yet.
