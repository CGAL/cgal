An object of class `Approximate_min_ellipsoid_d` is an approximation to the
ellipsoid of smallest volume enclosing a finite multiset of points
in \f$ d\f$-dimensional Euclidean space \f$ \E^d\f$, \f$ d\ge 2\f$.

An <I>ellipsoid</I> in \f$ \E^d\f$ is a Cartesian pointset of the form \f$ \{
x\in\E^d \mid x^T E x + x^T e + \eta\leq 0 \}\f$, where \f$ E\f$ is some
positive definite matrix from the set \f$ \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\f$, \f$ e\f$ is some
real \f$ d\f$-vector, and \f$ \eta\in\mathbb{R}\f$. A pointset \f$ P\subseteq \E^d\f$ is
called <I>full-dimensional</I> if its affine hull has dimension \f$ d\f$.
For a finite, full-dimensional pointset \f$ P\f$ we denote by \f$ (P)\f$ the
smallest ellipsoid that contains all points of \f$ P\f$; this ellipsoid
exists and is unique.

For a given finite and full-dimensional pointset \f$ P\subset \E^d\f$ and a
real number \f$ \epsilon\ge 0\f$, we say that an ellipsoid \f$ {\cal
E}\subset\E^d\f$ is an <I>\f$ (1+\epsilon)\f$-appoximation</I> to \f$ (P)\f$ if
\f$ P\subset {\cal E}\f$ and \f$ ({\cal E}) \leq (1+\epsilon)
((P))\f$. In other words, an \f$ (1+\epsilon)\f$-approximation to
\f$ (P)\f$ is an enclosing ellipsoid whose volume is by at most a
factor of \f$ 1+\epsilon\f$ larger than the volume of the smallest
enclosing ellipsoid of \f$ P\f$.

Given this notation, an object of class `Approximate_min_ellipsoid_d` represents an
\f$ (1+\epsilon)\f$-approximation to \f$ (P)\f$ for a given finite and
full-dimensional multiset of points \f$ P\subset\E^d\f$ and a real constant
\f$ \epsilon>0\f$.\cgalFootnote{A <I>multiset</I> is a set where elements may have multiplicity greater than \f$ 1\f$.} When an
`Approximate_min_ellipsoid_d<Traits>` object is constructed, an
iterator over the points \f$ P\f$ and the number \f$ \epsilon\f$ have to be
specified; the number \f$ \epsilon\f$ defines the <I>desired
approximation ratio</I> \f$ 1+\epsilon\f$. The underlying algorithm will then
try to compute an \f$ (1+\epsilon)\f$-approximation to \f$ (P)\f$, and one of
the following two cases takes place.
<UL>
<LI>The algorithm determines that \f$ P\f$ is not full-dimensional (see
`is_full_dimensional()` below).

<I>Important note:</I> due to rounding errors, the algorithm cannot
in all cases decide correctly whether \f$ P\f$ is full-dimensional or
not. If `is_full_dimensional()` returns `false`, the points
lie in such a "thin" subspace of \f$ \E^d\f$ that the algorithm is
incapable of computing an approximation to \f$ (P)\f$. More
precisely, if `is_full_dimensional()` returns `false`, there
exist two parallel hyperplanes in \f$ \E^d\f$ with the points \f$ P\f$ in
between so that the distance \f$ \delta\f$ between the hyperplanes is
very small, possible zero. (If \f$ \delta=0\f$ then \f$ P\f$ is not
full-dimensional.)

If \f$ P\f$ is not full-dimensional, linear algebra techniques should be
used to determine an affine subspace \f$ S\f$ of \f$ \E^d\f$ that contains the
points \f$ P\f$ as a (w.r.t.\ \f$ S\f$) full-dimensional pointset; once \f$ S\f$ is
determined, the algorithm can be invoked again to compute an
approximation to (the lower-dimensional) \f$ (P)\f$ in \f$ S\f$. Since
`is_full_dimensional()` might (due to rounding errors, see
above) return `false` even though \f$ P\f$ is full-dimensional, the
lower-dimensional subspace \f$ S\f$ containing \f$ P\f$ need not exist.
Therefore, it might be more advisable to fit a hyperplane \f$ H\f$
through the pointset \f$ P\f$, project \f$ P\f$ onto this affine subspace \f$ H\f$,
and compute an approximation to the minimum-volume enclosing
ellipsoid of the projected points within \f$ H\f$; the fitting can be
done for instance using the `linear_least_squares_fitting()`
function from the \cgal package `Principal_component_analysis`.
<LI>The algorithm determines that \f$ P\f$ is full-dimensional. In this
case, it provides an approximation \f$ {\cal E}\f$ to \f$ (P)\f$, but
depending on the input problem (i.e., on the pair \f$ (P,\epsilon)\f$),
it may not have achieved the desired approximation ratio but merely
some <I>worse</I> approximation ratio \f$ 1+\epsilon'>1+\epsilon\f$. The
achieved approximation ratio \f$ 1+\epsilon'\f$ can be queried using
`achieved_epsilon()`, which returns \f$ \epsilon'\f$. The ellipsoid
\f$ {\cal E}\f$ itself can be queried via the methods
`defining_matrix()`, `defining_vector()`, and
`defining_scalar()`.
</UL>

The ellipsoid \f$ {\cal E}\f$ computed by the algorithm satisfies the inclusions
\anchor eqapproximate_min_ellipsoid_incl
\f[
\frac{1}{(1+\epsilon')d} {\cal E} \subseteq \mathop{\rm conv}\nolimits(P) \subseteq {\cal E}
\f]
where \f$ f {\cal E}\f$ denotes the ellipsoid \f$ {\cal E}\f$ scaled by the
factor \f$ f\in\mathbb{R}^+\f$ with respect to its center, and where \f$ \mathop{\rm
conv}\nolimits(A)\f$ denotes the <I>convex hull</I> of a pointset
\f$ A\subset \E^d\f$.

The underlying algorithm can cope with all kinds of inputs (multisets
\f$ P\f$, \f$ \epsilon\in[0,\infty)\f$) and terminates in all cases. There
is, however, no guarantee that any desired approximation ratio
is actually achieved; the performance of the algorithm in this respect
highly depends on the input pointset. Values of at least \f$ 0.01\f$ for
\f$ \epsilon\f$ are usually handled without problems.

Internally, the algorithm represents the input points' Cartesian
coordinates as `double`'s. For this conversion to work, the input
point coordinates must be convertible to `double`. Also, in order
to compute the achieved epsilon \f$ \epsilon'\f$ mentioned above, the algorithm
requires a number type `ET` that provides <I>exact</I> arithmetic.
(Both these aspects are discussed in the documentation of the concept
`ApproximateMinEllipsoid_d_Traits_d`.)


\tparam Traits must be a model for `ApproximateMinEllipsoid_d_Traits_d`.

We provide the model `CGAL::Approximate_min_ellipsoid_d_traits_d<K>`
using the \f$ d\f$-dimensional \cgal kernel; the models
`CGAL::Approximate_min_ellipsoid_d_traits_2<K>` and
`CGAL::Approximate_min_ellipsoid_d_traits_3<K>` are for use with the
\f$ 2\f$- and \f$ 3\f$-dimensional \cgal kernel, respectively.

\sa `CGAL::Min_ellipse_2<Traits>`

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

We implement Khachyian's algorithm for rounding
polytopes \cgalCite{cgal:k-rprnm-96}. Internally, we use
`double`-arithmetic and (initially a single)
Cholesky-decomposition. The algorithm's running time is
\f$ {\cal O}(nd^2(\epsilon^{-1}+\ln d + \ln\ln(n)))\f$, where \f$ n=|P|\f$ and
\f$ 1+\epsilon\f$ is the desired approximation ratio.

\cgalHeading{Example}

To illustrate the usage of `Approximate_min_ellipsoid_d` we give two examples in 2D. The
first program generates a random set \f$ P\subset\E^2\f$ and outputs the
points and a \f$ 1.01\f$-approximation of \f$ (P)\f$ as an EPS-file, which
you can view using <TT>gv</TT>, for instance. (In both examples you can
change the variables `n` and `d` to experiment with the code.)

\cgalExample{Approximate_min_ellipsoid_d/ellipsoid.cpp}

The second program outputs the approximation in a format suitable
for display in Maplesoft's Maple.
