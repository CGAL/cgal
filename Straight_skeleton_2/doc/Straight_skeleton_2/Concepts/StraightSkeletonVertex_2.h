\cgalRefines `HalfedgeDSVertex`

The concept `StraightSkeletonVertex_2` describes the requirements for the vertex type of the
`StraightSkeleton_2` concept. It is a refinement of the `HalfedgeDSVertex` concept
with support for storage of the incident halfedge. The `StraightSkeletonVertex_2` concept
requires the geometric embedding to be a 2D point.
