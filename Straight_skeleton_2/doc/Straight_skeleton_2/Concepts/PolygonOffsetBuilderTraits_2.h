/*!
A predicate object type.

Must provide `Comparison_result operator()( FT d, const Trisegment_2_ptr& et) const`,
which compares the Euclidean distance `d` with the event time for `et`. Such event time
is the Euclidean distance at which the <I>offset lines</I> intersect in a single point.
The source of such offset lines is given by the three <I>oriented</I> lines defined by the edge-triple `et`.

\pre `et` must be an edge-triple corresponding to an event that actually exist (that is,
there must exist an offset distance `t > 0` at which the offset lines do intersect at a single point.

/*!
A construction object type.

Must provide `boost::optional<Point_2> operator()(const FT& t, const Segment_2& e0, Segment_2_with_ID const& e1, const Trisegment_2_ptr& et) const`,
which constructs the point of intersection of the lines obtained by offsetting
the oriented lines given by `e0` and `e0` an Euclidean distance `t`.

If `e0` and `e1` are collinear, if `seed` is not specified (`nullptr`), then the midpoint should be returned,
otherwise, the event point of `et` should be returned.

If the point cannot be computed, not even approximately (because of overflow for instance),
an empty optional must be returned.

\pre `et` must be an edge-triple corresponding to an event that actually exist (that is,
there must exist an offset distance `t > 0` at which the offset lines do intersect at a single point.
