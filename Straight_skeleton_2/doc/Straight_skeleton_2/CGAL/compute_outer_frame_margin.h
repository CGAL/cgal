\ingroup PkgStraightSkeleton2OffsetFunctions

computes the separation required between a polygon and the outer frame used to obtain an exterior skeleton
suitable for the computation of outer offset polygons at a given distance.

Given a non-degenerate strictly-simple 2D polygon whose vertices are passed
in the range [`first`,`beyond`), calculates the largest euclidean distance
`d` between each input vertex and its corresponding offset vertex at
a distance `offset`.

If such a distance can be approximately computed, returns an `optional<FT>` with the value `d + (offset * 1.05)`.
If the distance cannot be computed, not even approximately, due to overflow for instance,
returns an empty `optional<FT>` (an <I>absent result</I>).

This result is the required separation between the input polygon
and the rectangular frame used to construct an exterior offset contour
at distance `offset` (which is done by placing the polygon as a hole of that frame).

Such a separation must be computed in this way because if the frame is
too close to the polygon, the inward offset contour from the frame could
collide with the outward offset contour of the polygon, resulting in a merged
contour offset instead of two contour offsets, one of them corresponding to the frame.

Simply using `2*offset` as the separation is incorrect since `offset` is the distance
between an offset line and its original, not between an offset vertex and its original.
The later, which is calculated by this function and needed to place the frame sufficiently
away from the polygon, can be thousands of times larger than `offset`.

If the result is <I>absent</I>, any attempt to construct an exterior offset polygon at distance `offset` will fail.
This will occur whenever the polygon has a vertex with an internal angle approaching `0`
(because the offset vertex of a vertex whose internal angle equals 0 is at <I>infinity</I>).

The default traits class `Default_traits` is an instance of the
class `Polygon_offset_builder_traits_2<Kernel>` parameterized on
the kernel in which the type `InputIterator::value_type` is defined.

\tparam Traits must be a model for `PolygonOffsetBuilderTraits_2`.
\tparam InputIterator must be a model of `InputIterator` with `value_type` equivalent to `Traits::Point_2`.

\pre `offset > 0`.
\pre The range [`first`,`beyond`) contains the vertices of a non-degenerate strictly-simple 2D polygon.
