\brief creates a weighted straight skeleton in the interior of a 2D polygon with holes.

The outer contour is given by the point sequence `[outer_contour_vertices_begin, outer_contour_vertices_end]`
and its holes are given by `[holes_begin,holes_end[`. Weights of the outer contour are given by
`[outer_contour_weights_begin, outer_contour_weights_end[`, and weights of the holes are given by
`[holes_weights_begin, holes_weights_end]`, in the same order as holes appear in the iterator range.
Within each weight range, weights are given in the same order as the vertices of the contour:
the `i`-th weight in the range is associated to the contour edge between the `i-1`-th and `i`-th vertices.

\tparam PointIterator must be a model of `InputIterator` with value type `InK::Point_2`.
\tparam HoleIterator must be a model of `InputIterator` with `value_type` a model of `SequenceContainer`

Within each range of weights, the weights must be given in the same order as the vertices of the contour:

\brief creates a weighted straight skeleton in the <I>limited exterior</I> of the 2D polygon `P`
given by the point sequence `[vertices_begin,vertices_end[`.

The skeleton in the <I>limited exterior</I> of `P` is the skeleton in the interior of a polygon `Q`
with `P` as its hole and a rectangular frame `F` as outer boundary.
The outer boundary `F` is constructed by enlarging the bounding box of `P` by a distance `d`.
The distance `d` is a margin sufficiently large to allow an outer offset at distance `max_offset`
to be obtained from this exterior skeleton, as computed by the function `compute_outer_frame_margin()`.

Weights must be provided in the same order as the vertices of the polygon: the `i`-th weight in the range

\brief creates a weighted straight skeleton in the exterior of a 2D polygon (with holes).

The function returns a straight skeleton in the <I>limited exterior</I> of the 2D polygon `P`.
The skeleton in the <I>limited exterior</I> of `P` is the skeleton in the interior of a polygon `Q`
with `P` as its hole and a rectangular frame `F` as outer boundary.
The outer boundary `F` is constructed by enlarging the bounding box of `P` a distance `d`.
`d` is a margin sufficiently large to allow an outer offset at distance `max_offset` to be obtained
from this exterior skeleton, as computed by the function `compute_outer_frame_margin()`.

Weights must be provided in the same order as the vertices of the polygon: the `i`-th weight in the range
is associated to the contour edge between the `i-1`-th and `i`-th vertices.

\warning Holes of the polygon `P` are ignored. If you also need the exterior skeleton for the holes,
         you should call `CGAL::create_interior_straight_skeleton_2()` for each hole.

\tparam SsK must be a model of `Kernel`.
\tparam FT must be a model of `FieldNumberType` convertible to `SsK::FT`.
\tparam InKPolygon must be a model of `SequenceContainer` with value type `InK::Point_2` (e.g. `Polygon_2<InK>`)
                   or a model of `GeneralPolygonWithHoles_2` (e.g. `Polygon_with_holes_2<InK>`).
\tparam InKWeights must be a model of `Range` whose value type is itself a model of `Range` with value type `InK::FT`.

\note `Cartesian_converter` and `NT_converter` are used to convert objects from `InK` to `SsK`,
      if they differ.

\pre `P` is a weakly simple, counterclockwise polygon with clockwise oriented holes.
\pre Holes neither intersect each other nor the outer boundary.
