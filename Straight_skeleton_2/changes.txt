6 October 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Fixed a bug in the computation of the offset point along an inner bisector between collinear edges.

4 August 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Fixed bug in seed tracking

31 July 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Seed tracking added for correct handling of degenerate vertices
  (seed tracking refers to a 1 level history of the colliding edges which can be accessed when processing some non-initial event)

15 July 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Visitor added to allow users to monitor the algorithm progress

14 July 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Fixed a bug in the detection of events at time zero (which ought to be ignored)

5 July 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Merginig of coincident nodes now disabled by default (but can be requested)
- Computation of the coordinates of skeleton nodes now filtered
- Bug fixes in the handling of degnerate and near degenerate events
- Split-events clustered to reduce processing time (by a factor of 3)

20 June 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Bug fixes from user report (see pseudo_split_5.poly)
- Vertex-events replaced by Pseudo-split events


RELEASE 3.2



26 March 2006 Fernando Cacciola

23 March 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- More fixes for VC8

20 March 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Coincident-node merging added
- Base class qualification fixed for VC8

16 March 2006 Fernando Cacciola

16 March 2006 andreas Fabri
