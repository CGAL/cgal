of the points in the range [`first`,`beyond`).
The resulting sequence is placed starting at position
`result`, and the past-the-end iterator for the resulting
sequence is returned. It is not specified at which point the
cyclic sequence of extreme points is cut into a linear sequence.

This function implements Andrew's variant of the Graham
scan algorithm \cgalCite{a-aeach-79} and follows the presentation of Mehlhorn
\cgalCite{m-mdscg-84}. This algorithm requires \f$ O(n \log n)\f$ time
in the worst case for \f$ n\f$ input points.

generates the counterclockwise sequence of extreme
points from a given sequence of input points that are not left of the line defined
by the first and last points in this sequence.

More precisely, it generates the counterclockwise sequence of extreme
points from a given sequence of input points that are not left of the line
\f$ pq\f$ defined by the first (\f$p\f$) and last (\f$q\f$) points
in this sequence (\f$ p\f$ is the value of `first` and \f$ q\f$ is
the value of `beyond` \f$ -1\f$).
The resulting sequence is placed
starting at `result` with \f$ p\f$; point \f$ q\f$ is omitted.
The past-the-end iterator for the sequence is returned.

\pre The range [`first`,`beyond`) contains at least two different points. The points in [`first`,`beyond`) are sorted with respect to \f$ pq\f$, <I>i.e.</I>, the sequence of points in [`first`,`beyond`) define a counterclockwise polygon, for which the Graham-Sklansky-procedure \cgalCite{s-mcrm-72} works.

The default traits class `Default_traits` is the kernel in which the
type `BidirectionalIterator::value_type` is defined.

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

This algorithm requires \f$ O(n)\f$ time in the worst case for
\f$ n\f$ input points.

\cgalHeading{Example}

In the example \ref Convex_hull_2/ch_graham_anderson.cpp, `ch_graham_andrew_scan()` is used to
realize Anderson's variant \cgalCite{a-readc-78} of the Graham Scan
\cgalCite{g-eadch-72}. The points are sorted counterclockwise around the leftmost
point using the `Less_rotate_ccw_2` predicate, as defined in
the concept `ConvexHullTraits_2`. According to the definition
of `Less_rotate_ccw_2`, the leftmost point is the last point in the sorted
sequence and its predecessor on the convex hull is the first point in the
sorted sequence. It is not hard to see that the preconditions of
`ch_graham_andrew_scan()` are satisfied. Anderson's variant of the
Graham scan is usually inferior to Andrew's variant because of its higher
arithmetic demand.
