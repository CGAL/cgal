\cgalPkgDescriptionEnd

A subset \f$S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \f$ is convex if for any two points `p` and `q`
in the set the line segment with endpoints `p` and `q` is contained in \f$ S \f$.
The convex hull of a set \f$ S \f$ is the smallest convex set containing \f$ S \f$.
The convex hull of a set of points `P` is a convex polygon with vertices in `P`.
A point in `P` is an extreme point (with respect to `P`) if it is a vertex
of the convex hull of `P`.

\cgal provides functions for computing convex hulls in two dimensions as well
as functions for testing if a given set of points is strongly convex or not.
There are also a number of functions available for computing particular extreme
points in 2D and subsequences of the hull points, such as the lower hull or
upper hull of a set of points.

\cgalCRPSection{Assertions}

For the convex hull algorithms, the postcondition
check tests only convexity (if not disabled), but not containment of the
input points in the polygon or polyhedron defined by the output points.
The latter is considered an expensive checking and can be enabled by
defining `CGAL_CHECK_EXPENSIVE`.
