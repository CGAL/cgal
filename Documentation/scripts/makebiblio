\page how_to_cite_cgal Acknowledging %CGAL

\details %CGAL is implemented for the most part by researchers. The
academic world evaluates and rewards researchers for a good part by
the analysis of the number of published papers and the number of
citations of their papers, which measures their impact. In order to
make the %CGAL project attractive for researchers to contribute their
work (which allows users to benefit from new contributions), we are
pushing a model where the %CGAL manual chapters are considered like
publications, and can be cited in articles as such.

We therefore kindly ask users to cite %CGAL as appropriately as
possible in their papers, and to mention the use of %CGAL on the web
pages of their projects using %CGAL and provide us with links to these
web pages. Feel free to contact us in case you have any question or
remark on this topic.

We provide bibtex entries for the chapters of the User and Reference
Manual, as well as for publications directly related to the %CGAL
software.

## Citing the %CGAL Library or the %CGAL project ##

If you want to cite the %CGAL Library or project as a whole, please

- cite: %CGAL, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library, http://www.cgal.org 
- use the following <a href="how_to_cite_cgal.bib">bibtex entry</a>.

## Citing the User and Reference Manual ##

If you want to refer to %CGAL manual, please cite the appropriate
  entry from the bibliographic entries for individual chapters listed
  in the table below.
