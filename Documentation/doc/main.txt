This is the beta version of the %CGAL Manual generated with doxygen.
As it was generated semi-automatically from LaTeX sources of an
inhouse documentation tool, followed by months of postprocessing
we are happy about user feedback how we might improve things and
where we have documentation bugs.

For that we have set up a [tracker](https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?atid=13845&group_id=52&func=browse) where you can submit documentation bugs.

During beta we only provide the manual online, so that we can
publish fixes quickly.

About %CGAL
==========

The goal of the \cgal Open Source Project is to provide easy access to
efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++
library. %CGAL is used in various areas needing geometric computation,
such as: computer graphics, scientific visualization, computer aided
design and modeling, geographic information systems, molecular
biology, medical imaging, robotics and motion planning, mesh
generation, numerical methods... More on the [Projects Using %CGAL](http://www.cgal.org/projects.html) web page. 

The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library offers data structures
and algorithms like triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, Boolean
operations on polygons and on polyhedra, arrangements of curves, mesh
generation, geometry processing, convex hull algorithms, to name just
a few.

All these data structures and algorithms operate on geometric objects
like points and segments, and perform geometric tests on them. These
objects and predicates are regrouped in \ref PartKernels "CGAL Kernels".

Finally, the \ref PartSupportLibrary "Support Library" offers geometric object generators and
spatial sorting functions, as well as a matrix search framework and a
solver for linear and quadratic programs. It further offers interfaces
to third party software such as the GUI libraries Qt, Geomview, and
the Boost Graph Library.

Organization of the Manual
==========================

This manual is organized in several parts covering the many domains
of computational geometry. Each part consists of several chapters,
and each chapter is split into a *user manual*  and a *reference
manual*. The user manual gives the general idea and comes with examples.
The reference manual presents the \sc{Api} of the various classes
and functions.

The manual has a package overview, gives a short paragraph what the package is about, what license
it has, and on which other packages it depends. It further provides
links to precompiled demo programs for the Windows platform.

The manual further has a class index, as well as a search box in the upper right of
each page.
The scope of the search box is the package you currently look at and the 
packages it depends on, or  it is the whole manual when you are in
a top level page such as the package overview.


Demos and Examples
==================

In the distribution of the library  you find the two directories *demo*
and *examples*. They contain subdirectories for the \cgal packages.  
The demos use third party libraries for the graphical user interface. The 
examples don't have this dependency and most examples are refered to in the 
user manual.

License
=======
%CGAL is distributed under a dual-license scheme. %CGAL can be used
together with Open Source software free of charge. Using %CGAL in
other contexts can be done by obtaining a commercial license from
[GeometryFactory](http://www.geometryfactory.com). For more details
see the \ref licenseIssues "License" page.
