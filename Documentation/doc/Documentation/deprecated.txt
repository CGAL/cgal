\page deprecated Deprecation Notice

In \cgal, we are trying as much as possible not to break the backward compatibility. If we have to do it, it will be announced in the <a href="https://www.cgal.org/releases.html">release notes</a> ,
and a solution will always be provided. When possible, we keep the deprecated API for two releases before removing it.
If you reached this page after clicking on a link, it must probably mean that the documentation page you were trying to reach
is now deprecated. Have a look at the <a href="https://www.cgal.org/releases.html">release notes</a> for more information.
