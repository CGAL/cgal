\page usage Using %CGAL on Unix (Linux, macOS, ...)
\cgalAutoToc

Since \cgal version 5.0, \cgal is header-only be default, which means
that there is <b>no need to build \cgal before it can be used</b>.
However, some dependencies of \cgal might still need to be installed.

\section usage_introduction Quick Start: Compiling a Program using CGAL

Assuming that you have obtained \cgal through one of the package managers offering \cgal on your platform
(see Section \ref secgettingcgal), you can download \cgal examples (
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/download/v\cgalReleaseNumber/CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber-examples.tar.xz">CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber-examples.tar.xz</a>)
and the compilation of an example is as simple as:

    cd $HOME/CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber/examples/Triangulation_2 # go to an example directory
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release . # configure the examples
    make # build the examples

Compiling your own program is similar:

    cd /path/to/your/program
    path/to/cgal/Scripts/scripts/cgal_create_CMakeLists -s your_program
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
    make

The script `cgal_create_CMakeLists` and its options are detailed in Section \ref devman_create_cgal_CMakeLists.

In a less ideal world, you might have to install some required tools and third-party libraries.
This is what this page is about.

\section secprerequisites Prerequisites

Using \cgal requires a few core components to be previously installed:
<ul>
<li> a supported compiler (see Section \ref seccompilers),</li>
<li> \ref seccmake,</li>
<li> \ref thirdpartyBoost,</li>
<li> a \ref thirdpartyMP.</li>
</ul>

Optional third-party software might be required to build examples and demos shipped with \cgal,
or to build your own project using \cgal, see Section \ref secoptional3rdpartysoftware.

\section secgettingcgal Downloading CGAL

\cgal can be obtained through different channels. We recommend using a package manager as
this will ensure that all essential third party dependencies are present, and with the correct versions.
You may also download the sources of \cgal directly, but it is then your responsibility to independently
acquire these dependencies.

The examples and demos of \cgal are not included when you install \cgal with a package manager,
and must be downloaded
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/download/v\cgalReleaseNumber/CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber-examples.tar.xz">here</a>.

\subsection secusingpkgman Using a Package Manager

On most operating systems, package managers offer \cgal and its essential third party dependencies.

On macOS, we recommend using of <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> in the following way:

    brew install cgal

On Linux distributions such as `Debian`/`Ubuntu`/`Mint`, use `apt-get` in the following way:

    sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev

For other distributions or package manager, please consult your respective documentation.

\subsection secusingwebsite Using CGAL Source Archive

You can also obtain the \cgal library sources directly from
<A HREF="https://www.cgal.org/download.html">https://www.cgal.org/download.html</A>.

Once you have downloaded the file `CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber``.tar.xz` containing the
\cgal sources, you have to unpack it. Under a Unix-like shell, use the
command:

    tar xf CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber.tar.xz

The directory `CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber` will be created. This directory
contains the following subdirectories:

| Directory                  | Contents   |
| :------------------------- | :----------|
| `auxiliary` (Windows only) | precompiled \gmp and \mpfr for Windows |
| `cmake/modules`            | modules for finding and using libraries |
| `demo`                     | demo programs (most of them need \qt, or other third-party products) |
| `doc_html`                 | documentation (HTML) |
| `examples`                 | example programs |
| `include`                  | header files |
| `scripts`                  | some useful scripts (e.g. for creating CMakeLists.txt files) |
| `src`                      | source files |

The directories `include/CGAL/CORE` and `src/CGALCore` contain a
distribution of the <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/exact/">Core library</a> version 1.7 for
dealing with algebraic numbers. Note that \core is not part of \cgal and has its
own license.

The only documentation shipped within \cgal sources is the present manual.
The \cgal manual can also be accessed online at
<a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/index.html">`https://doc.cgal.org`</a>
or downloaded separately at
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases">`https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases`</a>.

\section section_headeronly Header-only Usage

\cgal is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header-only">header-only</a> library, and as such
there is no need to even configure it before using it. Programs using \cgal (examples, tests, demos, etc.)
are instead configured using CMake and \cgal will be configured at the same time.

There is one exception to the last paragraph: if you want to install \cgal header files to
a standard location (such as `/usr/local/include`):

    cmake .
    make install

For more advanced installations, we refer to Section \ref installation_configwithcmake.

Note that even though \cgal is a header-only library, not all its dependencies
are header-only. The libraries \gmp and \mpfr, for example, are not
header-only. As such, these dependencies must be built or installed independently.

\section usage_configuring Configuring your Program

Before building anything using \cgal you have to choose the compiler/linker, set compiler
and linker flags, specify which third-party libraries you want to use and where they can be found.
Gathering all this information is called <I>configuration</I>. The end of the process is marked
by the generation of a makefile or a Visual \cpp solution and project file that you can use
to build your program.

CMake maintains configuration parameters in so-called <I>Cmake variables</I>, like the `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`
in the example above. These variables <I>are not environment variables</I> but <I>CMake variables</I>.
Some of the CMake variables represent user choices, such as `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`,
whereas others indicate the details of a third-party library, such as `Boost_INCLUDE_DIR`
or the compiler flags to use, such as `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`.

The most important CMake variable is the variable `CGAL_DIR`, which will serve to configure \cgal
as you configure your program.

In a typical installation of dependencies, almost all CMake variables will be set automatically.
The variable `CGAL_DIR` is also generally found when \cgal has been obtained via a package manager.
In the rare event that it has not, the variable `CGAL_DIR` should be set manually to:

<ul>
<li>something like `/usr/local/opt/cgal/lib/cmake/CGAL`, for Brew.</li>
<li>something like `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/CGAL`, for Linux distributions.</li>
</ul>

Note that you can also use `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to point to a directory that contains all dependencies, like so:

    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/my/custom/brew/installation/dir -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .

If \cgal has been obtained via other means, `CGAL_DIR` must point to the root directory
of the \cgal source code (either the root of the unpacked release tarball or the root
of the Git working directory).

It is also strongly recommended to set the build type variable to `Release` for performance reasons
if no debugging is intended. Users should thus run:

    cd CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber/examples/Triangulation_2
    cmake -DCGAL_DIR=$HOME/CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release . # we are here using a release tarball

The package Qt6 on brew is "keg-only", which means it is not "linked" with brew.
In order to link against Qt6, you need to run:

    brew link qt@6

After that, you will have to specify the Qt6_DIR by hand to cmake, using something like

    -DQt6_DIR=/usr/local/opt/qt6/lib/cmake/Qt6

where `/usr/local/` is actually your current brew installation directory. Check this directory
to be sure where the Qt6 is placed on your machine.

\subsection usage_configuring_cmake_gui Specifying Missing Dependencies

The configuration process launched above might fail if CMake fails to find
all the required dependencies. This typically happens if you have installed dependencies
at non-standard locations.
Although the command line tool `cmake` accepts CMake variables as arguments of the form
`-D<VAR>:<TYPE>=<VALUE>`, this is only useful if you already know which variables
need to be explicitly defined. or this reason, the simplest way to manually set the missing variables
is to run the graphical user interface of CMake, `cmake-gui`.

    cd CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber/examples/Triangulation_2
    cmake-gui .

After the `CMake` window opens, press 'Configure'. A dialog will pop up and you will have to choose
what shall be generated. After you have made your choice and pressed 'Finish', you will see
the output of configuration tests in the lower portion of the application.
Once these tests are done, you will see many red entries in the upper portion of the application.
Just ignore them, and press 'Configure' again. By now, CMake should have found most required
libraries and have initialized variables.
If red entries are still present, you must provide the necessary information (paths/values).
When all entries have been appropriately filled (and automatically filled values have been adjusted,
if desired) and lines are gray, you are now ready to press 'Generate',
and to exit `cmake-gui` afterwards.

\cgalAdvancedBegin
You may also decide to solve missing dependencies using the command line tool (which is not recommended).
If so, the page \ref configurationvariables lists variables which can be used to specify
the location of third-party software.
\cgalAdvancedEnd

If you do not need to debug, you should set the variable `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Release`.

\subsection usage_configuring_external Configuring an External Program

Running `cmake` (or `cmake-gui`) requires a `CMakeLists.txt` file. This file is automatically provided
for all shipped examples and demos of \cgal. For other programs, CMake can also be used to configure
and build user programs, but one has to provide the corresponding `CMakeLists.txt`.
This script can be generated either manually, or with the help of a shell-script,
see Section \ref devman_create_cgal_CMakeLists. Using this shell-script,
the process of configuring a user's program called `your_program.cpp` amounts to:

    cd /path/to/your/program
    path/to/cgal/Scripts/scripts/cgal_create_CMakeLists -s your_program
    cmake -DCGAL_DIR=$HOME/CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .

Note that the script `cgal_create_CMakeLists` creates a very coarse `CMakeLists.txt` file which
might not properly encode the third party dependencies of your program. Users are advised to look
at the `CMakeLists.txt` files in the example folder(s) of the package that they are using to
learn how to specify their dependencies.

\subsection usage_configuring_advanced_cmake Advanced Configuration Options

CMake keeps the variables that a user can manipulate in a so-called CMake cache, a simple text file
named `CMakeCache.txt`, whose entries are of the form `VARIABLE:TYPE=VALUE`. Advanced users can manually
edit this file, instead of going through the interactive configuration session.

\section usage_building_program Building your Program

The results of a successful configuration are build files that control the build step.
The nature of the build files depends on the generator used during configuration, but in most cases
they contain several <I>targets</I>, such as all the examples of the Triangulation_2 package.

In a \unix-like environment the default generator produces makefiles.
You can use the `make` command-line tool for the succeeding build step as follows:

    cd CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber/examples/Triangulation_2
    make # build all the examples of the Triangulation_2 package

\cgalAdvancedBegin
The build files produced by CMake are autoconfigured. That is, if you change any of the dependencies,
the build step automatically goes all the way back to the configuration step. This way, once the target
has been configured the very first time by invoking cmake, you don't necessarily need to invoke `cmake`
again. Rebuilding will call itself `cmake` and re-generate the build file whenever needed.
