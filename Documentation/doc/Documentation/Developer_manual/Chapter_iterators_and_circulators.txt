Iterators are a generalization of pointers that allow a programmer to work 
with different data structures (containers) in a uniform manner. 
An iterator is the glue that allows one to write a single implementation of 
an algorithm that will work for data contained in an array, a list or some 
other container - even a container that did not yet exist when the algorithm 
was implemented.

The concept of an iterator is one of the major tools of the genericity
in \stl.
Iterators are used almost everywhere in the \stl  to
achieve the communication between containers and algorithms.
Iterators are widely used in \cgal too.
\cgal extends the idea of the iterator, which works for linear data
structures, to circular data structures by defining the concept of
a circulator.
\ref PkgHandlesAndCirculatorsSummary "Circulators" are quite similar to iterators, with the
major difference being the absence of a past-the-end position in a sequence.
Note that circulators are NOT part of the \stl, but of \cgal.

In \cgal, we also define the concept of \ref PkgHandlesAndCirculatorsSummary "handle",

which behaves roughly
like a pointer to an object without an increment or decrement operation.
More details about handles and their requirements can be found in 
the \ref PkgHandlesAndCirculatorsSummary "chapter Circulators and Handles"
of the Support Library part of \cgal manual. 
Section  \ref sechandle_vs_it_vs_circ  below discusses when handles
should be used in your code.

The concepts of iterators is relatively well described in textbooks such as 
Stroustrup's book (<I>The C++ Programming Language</I> \cgalCite{cgal:s-cpl-97})
and Austern's book (<I>Generic Programming and the \stl</I> \cgalCite{cgal:a-gps-98})
and in chapter \ref PkgHandlesAndCirculatorsSummary "Handles and Circulators"
of the <I>Support Library</I> part of the \cgal manual.
which also presents the concepts of handles and circulators.
Thus we will not give a full description of these concept here
but only a few hints about how to use and write handle, iterators and circulators in \cgal.  Developers should consult the above-mentioned references to become
familiar with the iterator, circulator and handle concepts. In 
particular,  the notions of iterator and circulator ranges,
dereferencable and past-the-end values,
 mutable and constant iterators and circulators, 
and the different categories (forward, bidirectional, random-access, etc.) 
of iterators and circulators, are fundamental.

\section seciterator_traits Iterator and circulator traits 

Iterators and/or circulators are required to provide a set 
of types such as the `value_type` for the type of objects referred to by the iterator and circulator or the `difference_type`
 for the distance between two iterators or circulators.
These types are usually declared in the iterator or circulator classes. 
The iterator traits have been introduced to attach such types to pointer classes, thus enabling the  use of pointer classes as models of  iterator
and circulator concepts.  
Therefore, an algorithm using an iterator of the type `Iter` will find the 
relevant types in an instantiation of a small templated class 
`iterator_traits`.

There is a  general templated version
of `iterator_traits` that looks like:
\code{.cpp}
template <class Iter> 
struct iterator_traits {
  typedef typename Iter::iterator_category  iterator_category ;
  typedef typename Iter::value_type         value_type;
  typedef typename Iter::difference_type    difference_type;
  typedef typename Iter::pointer            pointer;
  typedef typename Iter::reference          reference;
};
\endcode
and a partial specialization of `iterator_traits` classes for pointers:

\code{.cpp}
template <class T> 
struct iterator_traits<T*> {
  typedef random_access_iterator            iterator_category ;
  typedef T                                 value_type;
  typedef ptrdiff_t                         difference_type;
  typedef T*                                pointer;
  typedef T&                                reference;
};
\endcode

\section secinput_and_output_iterators Input and output iterators 

<B>Operator * for input and output iterators</B>

The operator * of input and output iterators has a restricted semantics.
Input iterators are designed for input operations, and it is not
required that the value type `T`  
of  an input iterator `it` be assignable. 
Thus, while assignments of the type `t = *it` are the usual way
to get values from the input iterators,
statements like `*it = ...` are likely to be illegal.
On the other hand, output iterators are designed for write operations,
and  the only legal use of the operator * of an output iterator
`it` is in the assignment ` *it = ....`.
The code of a standard copy function of the \stl 
provides an example of both of these operations:

<A NAME="copy_function">
\code{.cpp}
template< class InputIterator, class OutputIterator>
OutputIterator copy(InputIterator first, 
                    InputIterator last,
                    OutputIterator result) {
    while (first != last)
    {
       *result = *first;
       ++first; 
       ++result;
    }
    return result;
}
\endcode
</A>

The first two arguments of `copy` are of type `InputIterator` 
(meaning any type that fulfills the requirements for an input iterator)
while the third one is of type `OutputIterator`. If these types 
were  exchanged, then the statement `*result = *first;`
might not be valid.

<B>Stream iterators</B>

\stl  provides a special type of input iterator called `istream_iterator`,

which is designed to be bound to an object of the class `istream` and 
provides a way to read a sequence of values from the input stream to which 
it is bound.  For example, the following code reads numbers of type 
`double` from the standard input stream `cin` and computes their sum.
\code{.cpp}
istream_iterator<double> it(cin);
istream_iterator<double> end();

double sum=0.0;
while(it != end) {
   sum += *it;
   ++it;
}
cout << sum << endl;
\endcode

In a similar fashion, \stl provides the type `ostream_iterator`, 

which is designed to be bound to an object of the class `ostream`  
and used to output values to the output stream to which it is bound.

\cgal provides extensions of the classes `istream_iterator`
and `ostream_iterator`. The class `CGAL::Ostream_iterator<T,Stream>` 
is an output iterator adaptor for the stream class `Stream` and value 

type `T`.  It provides output iterators that can be used to output values 
of type `T` to objects of the class `Stream`.
For example, the following code fragment inserts a list of segments into
a window stream (<I>i.e.</I>, it draws the segments in the window) using the 
standard copy function:

\code{.cpp}
typedef CGAL::Cartesian<double>   K;
typedef K::Segment_2              Segment;

std::vector<Segment>       segments;
Window_stream        W( 400, 400);

int main (int argc, char** argv)
{
  // initialize segments
  std::copy( segments.begin(),
             segments.end(),
             CGAL::Ostream_iterator< Segment, Window_stream>( W));
}
\endcode

Likewise, the class `CGAL::Istream_iterator<T,Stream>` is an input
iterator adaptor for the stream class `Stream` and value type `T`. 
These adaptors are particularly useful for stream classes that are similar to
but not derived from `std::istream` and `std::ostream`. The only 
requirements of the stream classes are that they define `operator>>`  
(for `Istream_iterator::value_type`) and `operator<<`
(for `Ostream_iterator::value_type`).

<B>Insert iterators</B>

Insert iterators are output iterators that can be used to insert items 
into containers.
With regular iterator classes, the code given above
for the `copy` function of \stl, 
causes the range `[first,last)` to be copied into an existing range 
starting with `result`. No memory allocation is involved and the
existing range is overwritten. With an 
insert iterator supplied as the third argument, the same code will 
cause elements to be inserted into the container with which the output
iterator is associated.  That is, new memory may be allocated for these
inserted elements.

The \stl provides three kinds of insert iterators: `insert_iterator`s,
`back_insert_iterator`s and `front_insert_iterator`s.
The `back_inserter_iterator`s are used to insert elements at the end of 
a container by using the `push_back` member function of the container.
Similarly, `front_insert_iterator`s are used to insert elements at the
beginning of a container by using the container's `push_front`
function.  The general `insert_iterator` is used to insert elements
at any point in a container, by using the container's `insert` 
member function and a provided location of the insertion.

For convenience, \stl  provides the templated
functions (or adaptors) 
`front_inserter`, 

`back_inserter`

and `inserter` to get insert iterators, also called inserters,
 from containers.

\code{.cpp}
template<class Container, class Iterator> 
insert_iterators<Container> inserter(Container& c, Iterator it); 

template<class Container> 
back_insert_iterators<Container> back_inserter(Container& c); 

template<class Container> 
front_insert_iterators<Container> front_inserter(Container& c); 
\endcode

Thus, the `inserter` adaptor can be called for any container that
has an `insert` member function, and `back_inserter`
(resp. `front_inserter`) can be called for any container that has a
`push_back` (resp. `push_front`) member function.

The following code will insert 200 copies of the value 7 at the end of
`vec`.
\code{.cpp}
void g(vector<int>& vec)
{
    fill_n(std::back_inserter(vec),200,7);
}
\endcode
and this code will insert the points contained in the vector `vertices`
into a Delaunay triangulation data structure:

\code{.cpp}

  typedef CGAL::Cartesian<double>                          K;
  typedef CGAL::Triangulation_euclidean_traits_2<K>        Gt;
  typedef CGAL::Triangulation_vertex_base_2<Gt>            Vb;
  typedef CGAL::Triangulation_face_base_2<Gt>              Fb;
  typedef CGAL::Triangulation_default_data_structure_2<Gt,Vb,Fb>
                                                           Tds;
  typedef CGAL::Delaunay_triangulation_2<Gt,Tds>           DT;

  DT triangulation;

  std::copy( vertices.begin(),
             vertices.end(),
             std::back_inserter( triangulation ));

\endcode

\section Developer_manualWritingcodewithandforiterators Writing code with and for iterators, circulators, and handles

Because you should write generic code for \cgal, algorithms that require
a sequence of data for input should be written to take an iterator 
(or circulator) range as input instead of, say, a particular container.
Similarly, algorithms that compute a sequence of data as output should 
place the output data into an output iterator range.  Both of these
points are illustrated by the prototype of the following function that
computes the convex hull of a set of points in two dimensions:

\code{.cpp}

// generates the counterclockwise sequence of extreme points
// of the points in the range [first,beyond).
// The resulting sequence is placed starting at position
// result, and the past-the-end iterator for the resulting
// sequence is returned. It is not specified at which point the
// cyclic sequence of extreme points is cut into a linear sequence.
template <class InputIterator, class OutputIterator>
OutputIterator
convex_hull_points_2(InputIterator first, InputIterator beyond,
                     OutputIterator  result, const Traits & ch_traits );

\endcode


Also, when writing container classes, you should be sure to provide
iterators and/or circulators for the containers and design the interfaces
so they can be used with generic algorithms from the \stl and other
\cgal algorithm.  Here we give a few more details about how to accomplish
these goals.

\subsection sechandle_vs_it_vs_circ Handle, iterator, or circulator? 

Handles are indirect references that do not move, so whenever you need a
pointer-like reference to a single element of a data structure, and it is
not necessary to iterate (or circulate), use a handle.
In contrast, iterators should be used when you want to move (that is, 
iterate) over a linear sequences of elements.
When the sequence is circular, prefer a circulator over an iterator.

\subsection secit_and_circ_code Writing functions for iterators AND circulators 

To make your code as generic as possible, you should, where appropriate,
write functions that can accept either a circulator range or an iterator
range to delimit the input values.  Since empty circulator ranges are
represented differently than empty iterator ranges, the following function
is defined in <TT><CGAL/circulator.h></TT> so the test for an empty range 
can be done generically:

One would use this function in conjunction with a `do-while` loop
as follows:

\code{.cpp}
if ( ! CGAL::is_empty_range( i, j) )
{
  do
  { 
    // ...
  } while ( ++i != j )
}
\endcode

The following two macros are also defined as a generic means for iterating
over either a linear or circular sequence:

`CGAL_For_all( ic1, ic2)`

`CGAL_For_all_backwards( ic1, ic2)`

See the chapter \ref PkgHandlesAndCirculatorsSummary "Handles and Circulators"
 in the <I>Support Library</I> part of \cgal manual 
for more information and examples.

\subsection secclass_iterator Writing an iterator for your container 

Every container class in \cgal should strive to be a model for the
\stl concept of a container.  As for all concepts, this means that 
certain types and functions are provided, as detailed, for example 
in \cgalCite{cgal:a-gps-98}.  For the purposes of this discussion, the relevant
types are:

<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP NOWRAP>

`iterator` 
        <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP NOWRAP>
 type of iterator 
    <TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP NOWRAP>
`const_iterator` 
        <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP NOWRAP>
 iterator type for container with constant elements

</TABLE>

and the relevant functions are:

\code{.cpp}
iterator begin(); // beginning of container
const_iterator begin(); // beginning of container with constant elements
iterator end(); // past-the-end value for container
const_iterator end(); // past-the-end value for container with constant elements
\endcode

Variations on the above names are possible when, for example, the container
contains more than one thing that can be iterated over.  See 
Section  \ref secnaming_scheme  for more details about the naming conventions
for iterators and their access functions.

\subsection secclass_circulator Writing a circulator for your container 

When a container represents a circular data structure (<I>i.e.</I>, one without a
defined beginning or end), one should provide circulators for the data
elements in addition to (or, where appropriate, instead of) the iterators.
This means that the following types should be defined:

<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP NOWRAP>

`circulator` 
        <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP NOWRAP>
 type of circulator 
    <TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP NOWRAP>
`const_circulator` 
        <TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP NOWRAP>
 circulator type for container with constant elements

</TABLE>

as well as two access functions, one for each of the two types, with names
that end in the suffix `_circulator` (Section  \ref secnaming_scheme ).

\section it_and_circit_and_circ_req_and_rec Requirements and recommendations 

Requirements:
<UL>
<LI>All container classes should provide iterator types and access functions.

<LI>All container classes that represent circular data structures should
      provide circulator types and access functions.

<LI>Take care that decrement of the past-the-end value
      is, in accordance with the standard, a legal operation for a 
      bidirectional iterator.

      This can, for example, be used to get the last element of 
      a sequence.
</UL>

Recommendations:
<UL>
<LI>Be aware that postincrement (respectively, postdecrement) is more
      expensive than preincrement (predecrement) since the iterator or
      circulator value must be copied in the former case.

<LI>Remember that iterators and circulators are intended to be lightweight 
      objects.  That is, copying them should require only constant time.

<LI>When writing a container-like structure, provide `push_back`, 
      `push_front`, and `insert` member functions
      so all insert iterators can be used with your container.
      
</UL>
