\page devman_submission Editorial Board

The editorial board is in charge of approving the inclusion of new packages
in the library.  This means that they assure that new contributions
<UL>
   <LI>are in keeping with the philosophy of \cgal (Chapter  \ref devman_intro );
   <LI>are generic and fit seamlessly with other parts of the library;
   <LI>satisfy the coding conventions of \cgal (Chapter  \ref devman_code_format );
   <LI>carefully and efficiently treat robustness issues
         (Chapter  \ref devman_robustness );
   <LI>are designed in a flexible, extensible, and easy-to-use fashion;
   <LI>and are designed to be technically feasible for the platforms
         supported by \cgal.
</UL>

Software specifications and implementations should be submitted to the
editorial board for approval. The process is described in the
<A HREF="https://www.cgal.org/review_process_rules.html">submission
  and review rules</A>.

One should write a specification for a new package
and submit it to the editorial board.
Ideally, this should be done before implementation of the package: This
ensures that time is not wasted in fixing code that may later be changed
due to the recommendations of the board.
Only after approval by the board will packages be included in new
public releases and then only if they pass the test suite, of course.

The current list of members of the editorial board can be found on the
<A HREF="https://www.cgal.org/people.html">web site</A>.
