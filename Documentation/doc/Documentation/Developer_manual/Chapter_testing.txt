\section pkgTestsuite Running the Testsuite Locally of a Single Package

Before submitting a change for integration into \cgal it is good style
to run the testsuite of the modified package and all packages that
could be impacted.

For details see <a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/wiki/Testing">Testing</a> on the CGAL wiki on github.
