\section Developer_manualReferencecounting Reference counting

As of release 2.1, a reference counting scheme is used for
the kernel objects in the kernels `Cartesian` and
`Homogeneous`.
All copies of an object share a common representation object storing
the data associated with a kernel object; see \cgalFigureRef{figrefcounted}.

The motivation is to save space by avoiding storing the same data more
than once and to save time in the copying procedure.
Of course, whether we actually save time and space depends on the size
of the data that we would have to copy without sharing representations.
The drawback is an indirection in accessing the data. Such an indirection is
bad in terms of cache efficiency.
Thus there are also non-reference-counting kernels available
`Simple_cartesian` and `Simple_homogeneous`.

\cgalFigureBegin{figrefcounted,reference_counting.png}
Objects using reference counting (bottom) share common representation; copying creates a new handle (drawn at the right) pointing to the same  representation as the object copied. Without reference counting (top)  all data are copied to the new object (drawn at the right);
\cgalFigureEnd

The reference counting in the kernel objects is not visible to a user
and does not affect the interface of the objects.
The representation object is often called
the <I>body</I>.
The object possibly sharing its representation with others
is called a <I>handle</I>,
because its data consists of a pointer
to its representation object only. If the implementation of the member
functions is located with the representation object and the functions in the
handle just forward calls to the body, the scheme implements the <I>bridge</I>
design pattern,
which is used to separate an interface from its implementation.
The intent of this design pattern is to allow for exchanging implementations
of member functions hidden to the user, especially at runtime.

\section Developer_manualHandleRep Handle & Rep

The two classes `Handle` and
`Rep` provide reference counting
functionality; see \cgalFigureRef{figHandleRep} . By deriving from these classes,
the reference counting functionality is inherited.
The class `Rep` provides a counter; representation classes
derive from this class.
The class `Handle` takes care of all the reference-counting
related stuff. In particular, it provides appropriate implementations of
copy constructor, copy assignment, and destructor. These functions
take care of the counter in the common representation.
Classes sharing reference-counted
representation objects (of a class derived from `Rep`) do not have to
worry about the reference counting, with the exception of non-copy-constructors.

There  a new representation object must be created and the pointer to the
representation object must be set.

If `CGAL_USE_LEDA`
is defined and `CGAL_NO_LEDA_HANDLE` is not
defined, the types `Handle` and `Rep` are set to the \leda types
`handle_base` and `handle_rep`, respectively (yes,
without a `leda_`-prefix). Use of the \leda class `handle_rep` implies
that \leda memory management
is used for the representation types.

\code{.cpp}
typedef handle_base      Handle;
typedef handle_rep       Rep;
\endcode

Scavenging \leda, we provide the identical functionality in the \cgal classes
`Leda_like_handle` and `Leda_like_rep`. If \leda is not available or
`CGAL_NO_LEDA_HANDLE` is set, `Handle` and `Rep` correspond to
these types.

\code{.cpp}
typedef Leda_like_handle Handle;
typedef Leda_like_rep    Rep;
\endcode

\section Developer_manualUsingHandleRep Using Handle & Rep

In order to make use of the reference counting provided by the
classes `Handle` and `Rep`, your interface class (the class providing
the interface of the geometric object) must be derived from `Handle` and
your representation class (the class containing the data to be shared) must be
derived from `Rep`:

\code{.cpp}
class My_rep : public Rep { /*...*/ };
class My_geo_object : public Handle
{
  public:
    My_geo_object(const My_geo_object& m);

    My_geo_object(Arg1, Arg2);
};
\endcode

The class `My_geo_object` is responsible for allocating and constructing
the `My_rep` object "on the heap".
Typically, a constructor call is forwarded to a
corresponding constructor of `My_rep`. The address of the new `My_rep`  is assigned to `PTR` inherited from `Handle`, e.g.:

\code{.cpp}
My_geo_object::My_geo_object(Arg1 a1, Arg2 a2)
{ PTR = new My_rep(a1, a2); }
\endcode

The default constructor of `Handle` is called automatically
by the compiler and the reference counting is initialized.
You always have to define a copy constructor for `My_geo_object`

and to call the copy constructor of `Handle` there:

\code{.cpp}
My_geo_object::My_geo_object(const My_geo_object& m)
 : Handle( m)
{}
\endcode

That's it!
There is no need to define a copy assignment operator nor is there a
need to define a destructor for the derived class `My_geo_object`!
Handle & Rep does the rest for you!
You get this functionality by including `CGAL/Handle.h`

It is common practice to add a (protected) member function `ptr()`
to the class `My_geo_object`,
which casts the `PTR` pointer from `Rep*` to the actual type
`My_rep*`.

Note that this scheme is meant for non-modifiable types. You are not allowed
to modify data in the representation object, because the data are possibly
shared with other `My_geo_object` objects.

\section Developer_manualTemplatedhandles Templated handles

Factoring out the common functionality in base classes enables reuse of
the code, but there is also a major drawback. The `Handle` class does not
know the type of the representation object. It maintains a `Rep*` pointer.
Therefore, this pointer must be cast to a pointer to the actual type
in the classes derived from `Handle`. Moreover, since the `Handle`
calls the destructor for the representation through a `Rep*`, the
destructor of `Rep` must be virtual. Finally, debugging is difficult,
again, because the `Handle` class does not know the type of the
representation object.
Making the actual type of the representation object a template parameter
of the handle solves these problems. This is implemented in class template
`Handle_for`.
This class assumes that the reference-counted class provides the
following member functions
to manage its internal reference counting:

<UL>
<LI>`add_reference`

<LI>`remove_reference`

<LI>`bool is_referenced`

<LI>`bool is_shared`

</UL>
See the UML class diagram in \cgalFigureRef{figHandleFor}.
The reference counting functionality and the required
interface can be inherited from class `Ref_counted`.

Kernel objects have used such a handle/rep scheme since release 2.2.

\section Developer_manualUsingtemplatedhandles Using templated handles

In order to make use of the reference counting provided by the
classes `Handle_for` and `Ref_counted`, your representation class,
let's say `My_rep` (the class containing the data to be shared),
must provide the interface described above (<I>e.g.</I>, by deriving
from `Ref_counted`), and your interface class (the class providing
the interface of the geometric object) must be derived from
`Handle_for<My_rep>`. It is assumed that the default constructor of
`My_rep` sets the counter to 1 (the default constructor of
`Ref_counted` does this, of course):

\code{.cpp}
class My_rep : public Ref_counted { /*...*/ };

class My_geo_object : public Handle_for<My_rep>
{
  public:
    My_geo_object(const My_geo_object& m);

    My_geo_object(Arg1, Arg2);
};
\endcode

You should also define a copy constructor for `My_rep` as this may be used
in in-place creation in the allocator scheme.
The constructors of class `My_geo_object` are responsible for constructing
the `My_rep` object.
Typically, a corresponding constructor call of `My_rep` is forwarded
to `Handle_for`.

\code{.cpp}
My_geo_object::My_geo_object(Arg1 a1, Arg2 a2)
 : Handle_for<My_rep>( My_rep(a1, a2)) {}
\endcode

Sometimes, you have to do some calculation first before you can
create a representation object in a constructor of `My_rep`.

Then you can use the `initialize_with()`
 member function
of `Handle_for`.

In both cases, `Handle_for` takes care of allocating space for
the new object.

If you define a copy constructor for `My_geo_object`
you have to call the copy constructor of `Handle_for` there:

\code{.cpp}
My_geo_object::My_geo_object(const My_geo_object& m)
 : Handle_for<My_rep>( m)
{}
\endcode

That's it! Again, there is no need to define a copy assignment operator
nor is there a need to define a destructor for the derived class
`My_geo_object`!  `Handle_for` does the rest for you!

`Handle_for` provides you with an option to modify the data. There is
a `copy_on_write()`

that should be called right before every modification of the data.
It ensures that only your data are overwritten:

\code{.cpp}
void
My_geo_object::set_x(double d)
{
  copy_on_write();
  ptr->x = d;
}
\endcode
You get this functionality by including `CGAL/Handle_for.h`

\section Developer_manualAllocation Allocation

Class `Handle_for` has two template parameters. Besides the
type of the stored object, there is also a parameter specifying an
allocator.
Any concrete argument must be a model for the `Allocator` concept
defined in the \cpp standard. There is a default value for the second
parameter defined as `CGAL_ALLOCATOR(T)`. But you can also choose your
own, for example

\code{.cpp}
class My_geo_object : public Handle_for<My_rep, leda_allocator<My_rep> >
{ /* ... */ };
\endcode

The default allocator is defined in `CGAL/memory.h`

See Chapter  \ref devman_memory_management  for more information.
