\cgalAdvancedBegin
Since \cgal version 5.0, \cgal is header-only, which means
that there is no need to compile \cgal or its libraries before it can be used.

This page is for advanced users that either want to install CGAL on their system, or want to build the examples,
tests and demos that are shipped in a git branch, for example.
If this is not your case, head over back to the page \ref general_intro.
\cgalAdvancedEnd

This page is a step-by-step description of how to configure and install \cgal, and (optionally)
build examples, tests and demos.

It is assumed that you have downloaded a source archive of \cgal, and are using Linux or macOS.

\section installation_idealworld Quick Installation

Ideally, installing \cgal, as well as compiling some examples shipped by \cgal is as simple as:

    cd $HOME/CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..                                                                          # configure CGAL
    make install                                                                      # install CGAL
    cd examples/Triangulation_2                                                       # go to an example directory
    cmake -DCGAL_DIR=$CMAKE_INSTALLED_PREFIX/lib/CGAL -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .    # configure the examples
    make                                                                              # build the examples

In a less ideal world, you might have to install some required tools and third-party libraries.
This is what this page is about.

\section installation_configwithcmake Configuring CGAL with CMake

Before building anything using \cgal, you have to choose the compiler/linker,
set compiler and linker flags and specify which
third-party libraries you want to use and where they can be found. Gathering
all this information is called <I>configuration</I>.
The end of the process is marked by the generation of a makefile that you can use to install \cgal.

CMake maintains configuration parameters in so-called <I>cmake variables</I>. Some of the CMake
variables represent user choices, such as `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, while others
indicate the details of a third-party library, such as `Boost_INCLUDE_DIR` or which compiler flags to use,
such as `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`.

The next sections first present the CMake variables related to \cgal, followed by more generic variables,
and finally the configuration and build processes.

\subsection seclibraries CGAL Libraries

\cgal has some optional components. During configuration, you can select the components that
you would like to use by setting a CMake variable of the form <TT>WITH_<library></TT>. By default all
are switched `ON`, but some have specific dependencies in addition to the essential ones, so if you don't
need those, don't hesitate to switch them `OFF`.
See the page
\ref secessential3rdpartysoftware for more information.

| Component   | CMake Variable | Functionality | Dependencies |
| :-------- | :------------- | :------------ | :----------- |
|   \cgal   | none           | Main library  | \gmp, \mpfr, \boost (headers) |
| `CGAL_ImageIO` | `WITH_CGAL_ImageIO` | Utilities to read and write image files  | \zlib, \vtk (optional) |
| `CGAL_Qt5`  | `WITH_CGAL_Qt5` | `QGraphicsView` support for \qt5-based demos | \qt5 |

\subsection installation_examples CGAL Examples and Demos

\cgal is distributed with a large collection of examples and demos. By default, these are <B>not</B> configured along with
the \cgal libraries, unless you set the variables `WITH_examples=ON` and/or `WITH_demos=ON`.
Additionally, even when configured with \cgal, they are not automatically built along with the libraries.
You must build the `examples` or `demos` targets (or IDE projects) explicitly.

If you do not plan to compile any demos, you may skip some of the dependencies (such as \qt),
as the corresponding \cgal-libraries will not be used. Note, however, that your own demos
might need these \cgal-libraries and thus their dependencies. See the page
\ref secessential3rdpartysoftware for more information.

\subsection installation_debugrelease Debug vs. Release

The CMake variable `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` indicates how to build the executables.
It accepts the values `Debug` or `Release`. Note that the default value is `Debug`, since it is
default value in `CMake`. If you do not plan on debugging, it is important to set the variable
to `Release` for performance reasons.

This is however not an issue for solution/project files, since the user selects the build type
from within the IDE in this environment.

\subsection installation_miscvariables Other CMake Variables

There are many more variables that can be used during configuration. The most important ones are:
<ul>
<li> `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir>`         installation directory [/usr/local]</li>
<li>`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug|Release>`    build type [Release]</li>
<li>`CMAKE_C_COMPILER=<program>`          C compiler [gcc]</li>
<li>`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<program>`        C++ compiler [g++]</li>
</ul>

In case you want to add additional compiler and linker flags, you can use
<ul>
<li>`CGAL_CXX_FLAGS`                      additional compiler flags</li>
<li>`CGAL_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS`            add. linker flags (static libraries)</li>
<li>`CGAL_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS`            add. linker flags (shared libraries)</li>
<li>`CGAL_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`               add. linker flags (executables)</li>
</ul>

Variants with the additional suffix "_DEBUG" and "_RELEASE" allow to set
separate values for debug and release builds. In case you do not want to add
additional flags, but to override the default flags, replace "CGAL" by
"CMAKE" in the variable names above.

A comprehensive list of CMake variables can be found on the \ref configurationvariables page.

Note that CMake maintains a cache name `CMakeCache.txt`. If you change options
(or your environment changes), it is best to remove that file to avoid
problems.

\subsection installation_configuring_gui Configuring CGAL with the CMake GUI

The simplest way to start the configuration process is to run the graphical
user interface of CMake, `cmake-gui`. You must pass as
argument the root directory of \cgal. For example:

    cd CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber/build
    cmake-gui .. # The two dots indicate the parent directory

After `cmake-gui` opens, press *Configure*.
A dialog will pop up and you will have to choose what shall be generated.
After you have made your choice and pressed *Finish*, you will see
the output of configuration tests in the lower portion of the application.
When these tests are done, you will see many
red entries in the upper portion of the application. Just ignore them and press *Configure*.
By now CMake should have found many libraries and have initialized variables.
If you still find red entries, you have to provide the necessary information.
This typically happens if you have installed software at non-standard locations.

Providing information and pressing *Configure* goes on until
all entries are grayed. You are now ready to press *Generate*. Once this is
done, you can quit `cmake-gui`.

If you do not need to debug, you should set the variable `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Release`.

\subsection installation_configuring_cmd Configuring CGAL with the cmake Command-Line Tool

Alternatively, you can run the command-line tool called `cmake`.
You pass as argument the root directory of \cgal.
The command line tool `cmake` accepts CMake variables as arguments of the form `-D<VAR>:<TYPE>=<VALUE>`, as
in the example above, but this is only useful if you already know which variables need to be explicitly defined.
For example:

    cd CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber/build
    cmake ..

The configuration process not only determines the location of the required dependencies, it also dynamically generates a
`compiler_config.h` file, which encodes the properties of your system and a special file named
`CGALConfig.cmake`, which is used to build programs using \cgal. The
purpose of this file is explained below.

\cgalAdvancedBegin
CMake keeps the variables that a user can manipulate in a
so-called <I>CMake cache</I>, a simple text file named
`CMakeCache.txt`, whose entries are of the form
`VARIABLE:TYPE=VALUE`. Advanced users can manually edit this file,
instead of going through the interactive configuration session.
\cgalAdvancedEnd

\subsection installation_cgalconfig CGALConfig.cmake

During configuration of the \cgal libraries a file named `CGALConfig.cmake` is generated
in \cgal's root directory (in contrast to \cgal's source directory that has been used
for installation). This file contains the definitions of several CMake variables
that summarize the configuration of \cgal and will be essential during the configuration and
building of a program using \cgal, see Section \ref installation_buildprogram.

\section seccmakeoutofsource Multiple Builds

While you can choose between release or debug builds,
it is not possible to generate different variants during a single configuration. You need to run CMake in a
different directory for each variant you are interested in, each with its own selection of configuration parameters.

CMake stores the resulting makefiles, along with several temporary and auxiliary files such
as the variables cache, in the directory where it is executed, called `CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`, but it
takes the source files and configuration scripts from
`CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`.

The binary and source directories do not need to be the same. Thus, you can configure multiple variants by creating a
distinct directory for each configuration and by running CMake from there. This is known in CMake terminology
as <I>out-of-source configuration</I>, as opposite to an <I>in-source
configuration</I>, as showed in the previous sections.
You can, for example, generate subdirectories `CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber``/build/debug` and
`CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber``/build/release` for two configurations, respectively:

    mkdir CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber/build/debug
    cd CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber/build/debug
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..

    mkdir CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber/build/release
    cd CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber/build/release
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..


\subsection ssec_installation_build_ex_demos Building Examples and Demos

Let's assume that you have turned on the configuration of examples
(`-DWITH_examples=ON`) and/or demos (`-DWITH_demos=ON`).

The results of a successful configuration are build files that control the build step.
The nature of the build files depends on the generator used during configuration, but in all cases they
contain several <I>targets</I>, one per executable, and a default global target corresponding
to all of them (called `examples` and/or `demos`).

For example, in a \unix-like environment the default generator produces makefiles.
You can use the `make` command-line tool for the succeeding build step as follows:

    # build all the selected examples at once
    make examples

None of these targets are included by default, so you need to build them explicitly
<I>after</I> the \cgal libraries have been successfully built.
The targets `examples` and `demos` include themselves all the targets
for examples and demos respectively.

    # build all examples at once
    make examples

    # build all demos at once
    make demos

If you are interested in the demos or examples of just a particular module, you can build them in the following way:

    make -C demo/Alpha_shapes_2      # equivalent to "cd demo/Alpha_shapes_2; make"
    make -C examples/Alpha_shapes_2  # equivalent to "cd examples/Alpha_shapes_2; make"

When using `UNIX Makefiles`, you can find out the exact name of the example or demo target
of a particular package by typing `make help | grep <package>`.

\cgalAdvancedBegin
The build files produced by CMake are autoconfigured. That
is, if you change any of the dependencies, the build step
automatically goes all the way back to the configuration step. This
way, once the target has been configured the very first time by
invoking cmake, you don't necessarily need to invoke `cmake`
again. Rebuilding will call itself `cmake` and re-generate the
build file whenever needed.
\cgalAdvancedEnd
\section secinstalling Installing CGAL

On many platforms, library pieces such as headers, docs and binaries
are expected to be placed in specific locations. A typical example
being `/usr/include` and `/usr/lib`. The process
of placing or copying the library elements into its standard location
is sometimes referred to as <I>Installation</I> and it is a
postprocessing step after the configuration step.

CMake carries out the installation by producing a build target named <I>install</I>.
Assuming you have successfully configured \cgal as demonstrated in the previous sections,
the installation simply amounts to:

    # install CGAL
    make install

\cgalAdvancedBegin
The files are copied into a directory tree relative to the <I>installation directory</I> determined by the
CMake variable `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. This variable defaults to `/usr/local` under \unix-like operating systems.
If you want to install to a different location, you must override that CMake
variable explicitly <I>at the configuration time</I> and not when executing the install step.
\cgalAdvancedEnd

The file `CGALConfig.cmake` is installed by default in
`$CMAKE_INSTALLED_PREFIX/lib/cmake/CGAL`.

\section installation_buildprogram Building a Program using CGAL

Similarly to \cgal and its libraries, compiling a program using \cgal is done in the usual
two steps of configuration and building.

The configuration process is also done using `cmake` (or `cmake-gui`) and requires a `CMakeLists.txt` file.
This file is automatically provided for all shipped examples and demos of \cgal.
For other programs, CMake can also be used to configure
and build user programs, but one has to provide the corresponding `CMakeLists.txt`.
This script can be generated either manually, or with the help of a shell-script,
see Section \ref devman_create_cgal_CMakeLists. Using this shell-script,
the process of configuring a user's program called `your_program.cpp` amounts to:

    cd /path/to/your/program
    cgal_create_CMakeLists -s your_program
    cmake -DCGAL_DIR=XXXXXX -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
    make

In order to configure a program, you need to indicate the location of the \cgal configuration file
in the CMake variable `CGAL_DIR` (as shown in the example above).
If you have installed \cgal, `CGAL_DIR` must afterwards be set to `$CMAKE_INSTALLED_PREFIX/lib/cmake/CGAL`.

The variable `CGAL_DIR` can also be an environment variable, but setting it manually makes particular sense
if you have multiple out-of-source builds of \cgal as in Section \ref seccmakeoutofsource.
