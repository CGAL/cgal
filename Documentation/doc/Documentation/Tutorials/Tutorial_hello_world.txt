This tutorial is for the %CGAL newbie, who knows C++ and has 
a basic knowledge of geometric algorithms. The first section
shows how to define a point and segment class, and how to
apply geometric predicates on them. The section further raises
the awareness that that there are serious issues when using
floating point numbers for coordinates. In the second section
you see how the 2D convex hull function gets its input
and where it puts the result.  The third section shows what
we mean with a \em Traits class, and the fourth section explains
the notion of \em concept and \em model.

\section intro_Three Three Points and One Segment

In this first example we see how to construct some points
and a segment, and we perform some basic operations on them.
 
All \cgal header files are in the subdirectory `include/CGAL`.  All \cgal 
classes and functions are in the namespace `CGAL`.  
Classes start with a capital letter, global
function with a lowercase letter, and constants are all uppercase.
The dimension of an object is expressed with a suffix.

The geometric primitives, like the point type, are defined in a \em kernel.
The kernel we have chosen for this first example uses `double`
precision floating point numbers for the %Cartesian coordinates of the point.

Besides the types we see \em predicates like the orientation test for
three points, and \em constructions like the distance and midpoint 
computation. A predicate has a discrete set of possible results,
whereas a construction produces either a number, or another
geometric entity.



\cgalExample{Kernel_23/points_and_segment.cpp}



To do geometry with floating point numbers can be surprising
as the next example shows.

\cgalExample{Kernel_23/surprising.cpp}

When reading the code, we would assume that it prints three times "collinear".
However we obtain:

\verbatim
not collinear
not collinear
collinear
\endverbatim


As the fractions are not representable as double precision number
the collinearity test will internally compute a determinant of a 3x3 matrix
which is close but not equal to zero, and hence the non collinearity for the
first two tests.  

Something similar can happen with points that perform a left turn,
but due to rounding errors during the determinant computation, it
seems that the points are collinear, or perform a right turn.

If you need that the numbers get interpreted at their full precision
you can use a \cgal kernel that performs exact predicates and 
extract constructions. 

\cgalExample{Kernel_23/exact.cpp}

Here comes the output and you may still be surprised.

\verbatim
not collinear
collinear
collinear
\endverbatim

In the first block the points are still not collinear,
for the simple reason that the coordinates you see as text
get turned into floating point numbers. When they are then
turned into arbitrary precision rationals, they exactly
represent the floating point number, but not the text.

This is different in the second block, which corresponds
to reading numbers from a file. The arbitrary precision
rationals are then directly constructed from a string
so that they represent exactly the text.

In the third block you see that constructions as
midpoint constructions are exact, just as the name
of the kernel type suggests.


In many cases you will have floating point numbers that are "exact",
in the sense that they were computed by some application or obtained
from a sensor. They are not the string "0.1" or computed on the 
fly as "1.0/10.0", but a full precision floating point number.
If they are input to an algorithm that makes no constructions
you can use a kernel that provides exact predicates, but inexact
constructions.  An example for that is the convex hull algorithm
which we will see in the next section.
The output is a subset of the input, and the algorithm 
only compares coordinates and performs orientation tests. 

At a first glance the kernel doing exact predicates and constructions
seems to be the perfect choice, but performance requirements
or limited memory resources make that it is not. Also for many
algorithms it is irrelevant to do exact constructions. For example
a surface mesh simplification algorithm that iteratively contracts
an edge, by collapsing it to the midpoint of the edge.

Most \cgal packages explain what kind of kernel they need or support.


\section intro_convex_hull The Convex Hull of a Sequence of Points

All examples in this section compute the 2D convex hull of a set of points.
We show that algorithms get their input as a begin/end iterator pair 
denoting a range of points, and that they write the result, in the
example the points on the convex hull, into an output iterator.


\subsection intro_array The Convex Hull of Points in a Built-in Array

In the first example we have as input an array of five points.
As the convex hull of these points is a subset of the input
it is safe to provide an array for storing the result which
has the same size.

\cgalExample{Convex_hull_2/array_convex_hull_2.cpp}

 We saw in the previous section that \cgal comes
with several kernels. As the convex hull algorithm only makes
comparisons of coordinates and orientation tests of input points,
we can choose a kernel that provides exact predicates, but no 
exact geometric constructions.

The convex hull function takes three arguments, the start
and past-the-end pointer for the input, and the start pointer of the 
array for the result. The function returns the pointer
into the result array just behind the last convex hull
point written, so the pointer difference tells us how
many points are on the convex hull. 
 

\subsection intro_vector The Convex Hull of Points in a Vector

In the second example we replace the built-in array
by a `std::vector` of the Standard Template Library.

\cgalExample{Convex_hull_2/vector_convex_hull_2.cpp}

We put some points in the vector calling the `push_back()`
method of the `std::vector` class.

We then call the convex hull function. The first two arguments,
`points.begin()` and `points.end()` are *iterators*, which are a
generalization of pointers: they can be dereferenced and
incremented. The convex hull function is *generic* in the sense
that it takes as input whatever can be dereferenced and incremented.

The third argument is where the result gets written to.  In the
previous example we provided a pointer to allocated memory.  The
generalization of such a pointer is the *output iterator*, which
allows to increment and assign a value to the dereferenced iterator.
In this example we start with an empty vector which grows as needed.
Therefore, we cannot simply pass it `result.begin()`, but an output
iterator generated by the helper function
`std::back_inserter(result)`. This output iterator does nothing when
incremented, and calls `result.push_back(..)` on the assignment.


If you know the \stl, the Standard Template Library, the above makes
perfect sense, as this is the way the \stl decouples algorithms from
containers. If you don't know the \stl, you maybe better first
familiarize yourself with its basic ideas.


\section intro_traits About Kernels and Traits Classes

In this section we show how we express the requirements that must
be fulfilled in order that a function like `convex_hull_2()`
can be used with an arbitrary point type.

If you look at the manual page of the function `convex_hull_2()`
and the other 2D convex hull algorithms, you see that they come in two
versions. In the examples we have seen so far the function that takes two
iterators for the range of input points and an output iterator for
writing the result to. The second version has an additional template
parameter `Traits`, and an additional parameter of this type.

\code{.cpp}
template<class InputIterator , class OutputIterator , class Traits >
OutputIterator 
convex_hull_2(InputIterator first,
              InputIterator beyond,
              OutputIterator result,
              const Traits & ch_traits)
\endcode 	

What are the geometric primitives a typical convex hull algorithm
uses? Of course, this depends on the algorithm, so let us consider
what is probably the simplest efficient algorithm, the so-called
"Graham/Andrew Scan". This algorithm first sorts the points from left
to right, and then builds the convex hull incrementally by adding one
point after another from the sorted list. To do this, it must at least
know about some point type, it should have some idea how to sort those
points, and it must be able to evaluate the orientation of a triple of
points.

And that is where the template parameter `Traits` comes in.
For `ch_graham_andrew()` it must provide the following nested types:

- `Traits::Point_2`
- `Traits::Less_xy_2`
- `Traits::Left_turn_2`
- `Traits::Equal_2`


As you can guess, `Left_turn_2` is responsible for the orientation
test, while `Less_xy_2` is used for sorting the points. The requirements these
types have to satisfy are documented in full with the concept
`ConvexHullTraits_2`.



The types are regrouped for a simple reason. The alternative would
have been a rather lengthy function template, and an even longer 
function call.

\code{.cpp}
template <class InputIterator, class OutputIterator, class Point_2, class Less_xy_2, class Left_turn_2, class Equal_2>
OutputIterator
ch_graham_andrew( InputIterator  first,
                  InputIterator  beyond,
                  OutputIterator result);
\endcode

There are two obvious questions: What can be used as argument for
this template parameter? And why do we have template parameters at all?

To answer the first question, any model of the %CGAL concept `Kernel` provides
what is required by the concept `ConvexHullTraits_2`.

As for the second question, think about an application where we want to 
compute the convex hull of 3D points projected into the `yz` plane. Using
the class `Projection_traits_yz_3` this is a small modification
of the previous example.

\cgalExample{Convex_hull_2/convex_hull_yz.cpp}

Another example would be about a user defined point type, or a point
type coming from a third party library other than %CGAL. Put the point
type together with the required predicates for this point type in the
scope of a class, and you can run `convex_hull_2()` with these
points.

Finally, let us explain why a traits object that is passed to the
convex hull function?  It would allow to use a more general projection
traits object to store state, for example if the projection plane was
given by a direction, which is hardwired in the class
`Projection_traits_yz_3`.


\section intro_concept Concepts and Models

In the previous section we wrote that "Any model of the CGAL concept
Kernel provides what is required by the concept ConvexHullTraits_2".

A \em concept is a set of requirements on a type, namely that it has
certain nested types, certain member functions, or comes with certain
free functions that take the type as it.   A \em model of a concept
is a class that fulfills the requirements of the concept.

Let's have a look at the following function.

\code{.cpp}
template <T>
T
duplicate(T t)
{
  return t;
}
\endcode

If you want to instantiate this function with a class `C` this
class must at least provide a copy constructor, and we 
say that class `C` must be a model of `CopyConstructible`. 
A singleton class does not fulfill this requirment.

Another example is the function

\code{.cpp}
template <typename T> 
T& std::min(const T& a, constT& b)
{
  return (a<b)?a:b;
} 
\endcode

This function only compiles if the `operator<<(..)` is defined for the type used as `T`,
and we say that the type must be a model of `LessThanComparable`.

An example for a concept with required free functions is the `HalfedgeListGraph` in the
\cgal package \ref PkgBGLSummary. In order to be a model of `HalfedgeListGraph` a class `G` 
there must be a global function `halfedges(const G&)`, etc.

An example for a concept with a required traits class is `InputIterator`.
For a model of an `InputIterator` a specialization of the class 
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_traits"> `std::iterator_traits`</a>
must exist (or the generic template must be applicable).

\section intro_further Further Reading

We also recommend the standard text books "The C++ Standard Library, A
Tutorial and Reference" by Nicolai M. Josuttis from Addison-Wesley, or
"Generic Programming and the STL" by Matthew H. Austern for the \stl
and its notion of *concepts* and *models*.
