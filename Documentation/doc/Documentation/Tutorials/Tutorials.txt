\page tutorials Tutorials

\cgal provides a large number of data structures and algorithms dedicated to
various applications. Most of these data structures and algorithms can be
combined to achieve extensive and complex geometric tasks. The tutorials aim at
providing help and ideas on how to use CGAL beyond the simple examples of the
User Manual.

\section tuto_list List of Available Tutorials

- \subpage tutorial_hello_world presents you some short example
  programs to get a first idea for the look and feel of a program that
  uses \cgal.  We introduce the notion of the \em kernel which defines
  geometric primitives, the notion of <em>traits classes</em> which
  define what primitives are used by a geometric algorithm, the
  notions of \em concept and \em model.

\section tuto_examples Package Examples

Each \cgal package comes with a set of commented examples that illustrate basic features of the package.
See for example Section \ref Triangulation3secexamples of the User Manual of the package \ref PkgTriangulation3.
