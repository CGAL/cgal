\page preliminaries General Information
\cgalAutoToc

The chapter explains some basic features of \cgal such as thread safety, code deprecation,
checking of pre- and postconditions and altering the failure behavior, and how to control inlining.

These concepts are further developed in the \ref dev_manual.

\section Preliminaries_namespace Namespace CGAL

All names introduced by \cgal, especially those documented in these
manuals, are in a namespace called `CGAL`, which is in global
scope. A user can either qualify names from \cgal by adding
`CGAL::`, e.g., `CGAL::Point_2< CGAL::Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel >`,
make a single name from \cgal visible in a scope via a `using`
statement, e.g., `using CGAL::Point_2;`, and then use this name
unqualified in this scope, or even make all names from namespace
`CGAL` visible in a scope with `using namespace CGAL;`. The
latter, however, is likely to give raise to name conflicts and is
therefore not recommended.


\section Preliminaries_thread_safety Thread Safety

\cgal is progressively being made thread-safe.  The guidelines which are followed
are:

- it should be possible to use different objects in different threads at the same time (of the same type or not),
- it is not safe to access the same object from different threads at the same time, unless otherwise specified in the class documentation.

If the macro `CGAL_HAS_THREADS` is not defined, then \cgal assumes it can use
any thread-unsafe code (such as static variables).  By default, this macro is not
defined, unless `BOOST_HAS_THREADS` or `_OPENMP` is defined.  It is possible
to force its definition in the compiler options, and it is possible to prevent its
default definition by defining the macro `CGAL_HAS_NO_THREADS`.
If you are using CMake, then you can set the CMake option `CGAL_HAS_NO_THREADS` to
`TRUE`. In addition to defining the preprocessor macro `CGAL_HAS_NO_THREADS`, it will
also avoid CMake to link with the native threads support library on your system.

\section Preliminaries_cc0x C++17 Support

\cgal is based on the version C++17 of the C++ standard.

\section preliminaries_secchecks Checks

Much of the \cgal code contains assert statements for preconditions, and postconditions of functions
as well as in the code.  These assertions can be switched on and off per package
and the user can change the error behaviour. For details see Section \ref secchecks
of Chapter \ref Chapter_STL_Extensions_for_CGAL.

\section Preliminaries_flags Compile-time Flags to Control Inlining

Making functions inlined can, at times, improve the efficiency of your code.
However this is not always the case and it can differ for a single function
depending on the application in which it is used. Thus \cgal defines a set
of compile-time macros that can be used to control whether certain functions
are designated as inlined functions or not.  The following table lists the
macros and their default values, which are set in one of the \cgal include
files.

| Macro Name                   | Default |
| :---------                   | :------ |
| `CGAL_KERNEL_INLINE`         | inline  |
| `CGAL_KERNEL_MEDIUM_INLINE`  |         |
| `CGAL_KERNEL_LARGE_INLINE`   |         |
| `CGAL_MEDIUM_INLINE`         | inline  |
| `CGAL_LARGE_INLINE`          |         |
| `CGAL_HUGE_INLINE`           |         |

If you wish to change the value of one or more of these macros,
you can simply give it a new value when compiling.  For example, to make
functions that use the macro `CGAL_KERNEL_MEDIUM_INLINE` inline functions,
you should set the value of this macro to `inline` instead of the
default blank.

Note that setting inline manually is very fragile, especially in a template
context.  It is usually better to let the compiler select by himself which
functions should be inlined or not.

\section seccgal_version Identifying the Version of CGAL

Every release of \cgal defines the following preprocessor macros:

<DL>
<DT>`CGAL_VERSION_STR`</DT>
<DD>a textual description of the current release (e.g., or 3.3 or 3.2.1 or 3.2.1-I-15) as a string literal</DD>
<DT>`CGAL_VERSION_NR`</DT>
<DD>a numerical description of the current release such that more recent
releases have higher number.

More precisely, it is defined as `1MMmmbiiii`, where `MM` is
the major release number (e.g. 03), `mm` is the minor release
number (e.g. 02), `b` is the bug-fix release number (e.g. 0),
and `iiii` is the internal release number (e.g. 0001). For
public releases, the latter is defined as 1000.  Examples: for the
public release 3.2.4 this number is 1030241000; for internal release
3.2-I-1, it is 1030200001.  Note that this scheme was modified around
3.2-I-30.
</DD>
<DT>`CGAL_VERSION_NUMBER(M,m,b)`</DT>
<DD>
a function macro computing the version number macro from the
M.m.b release version. Note that the internal release number is
dropped here. Example: `CGAL_VERSION_NUMBER(3,2,4)` is equal to
1030241000.
</DD>
</DL>

The macro `CGAL_VERSION` is deprecated. It is the same as
`CGAL_VERSION_STR`, but not as a string literal.
