\section seccompilers Supported Compilers

In order to build a program using \cgal, you need a \cpp compiler
supporting <a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/cpp14">C++14</a> or later.
\cgal \cgalReleaseNumber is supported, that is continuously tested, for the following compilers/operating systems:

| Operating System | Compiler |
| :------- | :--------------- |
| Linux | \sc{Gnu} `g++` 6.3 or later\cgalFootnote{<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/">`http://gcc.gnu.org/`</A>} |
|       | `Clang` \cgalFootnote{<A HREF="http://clang.llvm.org/">`http://clang.llvm.org/`</A>} compiler version 8.0.0 |
| \sc{MS} Windows | \sc{Gnu} `g++` 6.3 or later\cgalFootnote{<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/">`http://gcc.gnu.org/`</A>} |
|                 | \sc{MS} Visual `C++` 14.0, 15.9, 16.0 (\sc{Visual Studio} 2015, 2017, and 2019)\cgalFootnote{<A HREF="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">`https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/`</A>} |
| MacOS X | \sc{Gnu} `g++` 6.3 or later\cgalFootnote{<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/">`http://gcc.gnu.org/`</A>} |
|         | Apple `Clang` compiler versions 7.0.2 and 10.0.1 |

It may work for older versions of the above listed compilers.

\section seccmake CMake

In order to configure and build the \cgal libraries, examples, and demos,
you need CMake, a cross-platform "makefile generator".
If CMake is not already installed you can obtain it from <A HREF="https://cmake.org/">`https://cmake.org/`</A>.
CMake version 3.1 or higher is required.

This manual explains only those features of
CMake which are needed in order to build \cgal. Please refer to the
CMake documentation at <A HREF="https://cmake.org/">`https://cmake.org/`</A> for further details.

\section secessential3rdpartysoftware Essential Third Party Libraries

The focus of \cgal is on geometry, and we rely on other
highly specialized libraries and software for non-geometric issues,
for instance, for numeric solvers, or visualization. We first list software
that is essential to build (all) libraries of \cgal, that is,
this software must be found during the configuration of \cgal for an
actived library of \cgal (i.e.\ <TT>WITH_<library>=ON</TT>);
see the page \ref configurationvariables to specify the location of 3rd
party software.

The libraries \stl (shipped with any compiler) and \sc{Boost} are essential to all components (i.e.\ libCGAL,
libCGAL_Core, libCGAL_ImageIO, and libCGAL_Qt5).

\subsection thirdpartystl Standard Template Library (STL)

\cgal heavily uses the \stl, and in particular adopted
many of its design ideas. You can find online
documentation for the \stl at various web sites, for instance,
<A HREF="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">`https://en.cppreference.com `</A>,
or <A HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1fe2x6kt(v=vs.140).aspx">`https://msdn.microsoft.com`</A>.

The \stl comes with the compiler, so there is nothing to install.

\subsection thirdpartyBoost Boost

The \sc{Boost} libraries are a set of portable C++ source libraries. Most of
\sc{Boost} libraries are header-only, but a few of them need to be compiled or
installed as binaries.

\cgal only requires the headers of the \sc{Boost} libraries, but some demos and examples depend on the binary library `Boost.Program_options`.

As an exception, because of a bug in the \gcc compiler about the \cpp 11
keyword `thread_local`, the `CGAL_Core` library always requires
the binary library `Boost.Thread` if the \gcc compiler version 9.0 or
earlier is used.

In case the \sc{Boost} libraries are not installed on your system already, you
can obtain them from <A HREF="https://www.boost.org/">`https://www.boost.org/`</A>. For Visual C++ you can download precompiled libraries
from <A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/">`https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/`</A>.

As on Windows there is no canonical directory for where to find
\sc{Boost}, we recommend that you define the environment variable
`BOOST_ROOT` and set it to where you have installed \sc{Boost}, e.g.,
<A HREF="C:\boost\boost_1_41_0">`C:\boost\boost_1_41_0`</A>.

\subsection thirdpartyMPFR GMP and MPFR

The components libCGAL, libCGAL_Core, and libCGAL_Qt5 require
\sc{Gmp} and \sc{Mpfr} which are libraries for multi precision integers and rational numbers,
and for multi precision floating point numbers.

\cgal combines floating point arithmetic with exact arithmetic,
in order to be efficient and reliable. \cgal has a built-in
number type for that, but \sc{Gmp} and \sc{Mpfr} provide a faster
solution, and we recommend to use them.

Having \sc{Gmp} version 4.2 or higher and \sc{Mpfr} version 2.2.1 or higher
installed is recommended. These libraries can be obtained from
<A HREF="https://gmplib.org/">`https://gmplib.org/`</A> and <A HREF="https://www.mpfr.org/">`https://www.mpfr.org/`</A>, respectively.

As Visual \cpp is not properly
supported by the \sc{Gmp} and \sc{Mpfr} projects, we provide precompiled versions
of \sc{Gmp} and \sc{Mpfr}, which can be downloaded with the installer
`CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber``-Setup.exe`.

\subsection thirdpartyzlib zlib

\sc{zlib} is a data compression library, and is essential for the component libCGAL_ImageIO.

In \cgal this library is used in the examples of the \ref PkgSurfaceMesher3Ref package.

If it is not already on your system,
for instance, on Windows, you can download it from <A HREF="https://www.zlib.net/">`https://www.zlib.net/`</A>.

\subsection thirdpartyQt Qt5

Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework.

The component libCGAL_Qt5 requires \sc{Qt}5 installed on your system.
In case \sc{Qt} is not yet installed on your system, you can download
it from <A HREF="https://www.qt-project.org/">`https://www.qt-project.org/`</A>.

The exhaustive list of \sc{Qt}5 components used in demos is:
`Core`, `Gui`, `Help`, `OpenGL`, `Script`, `ScriptTools`, `Svg`, `Widgets`,
`qcollectiongenerator` (with `sqlite` driver plugin) and `Xml`.

\sc{Qt} version 5.9.0 or later is required.

\section secoptional3rdpartysoftware Optional Third Party Libraries

Optional 3rd party software can be used by \cgal for various reasons:
Usually certain optional libraries are required to build examples and
demos shipped with \cgal or to build your own project using \cgal.
Another reason is to speed up basic tasks.

\subsection thirdpartyLeda LEDA

\leda is a library of efficient data structures and
algorithms. Like \sc{Core}, \leda offers a real number data type.

In \cgal this library is optional, and its number types can
be used as an alternative to \sc{Gmp}, \sc{Mpfr}, and \sc{Core}.

Free and commercial editions of \leda are available from <A HREF="https://www.algorithmic-solutions.com">`https://www.algorithmic-solutions.com`</A>.

\subsection thirdpartyMPFI MPFI

\sc{Mpfi} provides arbitrary precision interval arithmetic with intervals
represented using \sc{Mpfr} reliable floating-point numbers.
It is based on the libraries \sc{Gmp} and \sc{Mpfr}.
In the setting of \cgal, this library is
optional: it is used by some models of the
\ref PkgAlgebraicKernelDRef "Algebraic Kernel".

\sc{Mpfi} can be downloaded from <A HREF="https://mpfi.gforge.inria.fr/">`https://mpfi.gforge.inria.fr/`</A>. Version 1.4 or higher is recommended.

\subsection thirdpartyRS3 RS and RS3

\sc{Rs} (Real Solutions) is devoted to the study of the real roots of
polynomial systems with a finite number of complex roots (including
univariate polynomials). In \cgal, \sc{Rs} is used by one model of the
\ref PkgAlgebraicKernelDRef "Algebraic Kernel".

\sc{Rs} is freely distributable for non-commercial use. You can download it
from <a href="http://vegas.loria.fr/rs/">`http://vegas.loria.fr/rs/`</a>. Actually, the \sc{Rs} package also includes \sc{Rs3}, the
successor of \sc{Rs}, which is used in conjunction with it.

The libraries \sc{Rs} and \sc{Rs3} need \sc{Mpfi}, which can be downloaded from
<A HREF="https://mpfi.gforge.inria.fr/">`https://mpfi.gforge.inria.fr/`</A>.

\subsection thirdpartyNTL NTL

\sc{Ntl} provides data structures and algorithms for signed, arbitrary
length integers, and for vectors, matrices, and polynomials over the
integers and over finite fields. The optional library \sc{Ntl} is used by \cgal
to speed up operations of the Polynomial package, such as GCDs. It is recommended to install \sc{Ntl} with support from \sc{Gmp}.

\sc{Ntl} can be downloaded from <A HREF="https://www.shoup.net/ntl/">`https://www.shoup.net/ntl/`</A>. Version 5.1 or higher is recommended.
