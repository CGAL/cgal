\section seccompilers Supported Compilers

In order to build a program using \cgal, you need a \cpp compiler
supporting <a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/cpp14">C++14</a> or later.
\cgal \cgalReleaseNumber is supported (continuously tested) for the following compilers/operating systems:

| Operating System | Compiler |

<!-- Windows supported version are also listed on windows.html (must change both) -->

Older versions of the above listed compilers might work, but no guarantee is provided.

\section seccmake CMake
<b>Version 3.1 or later</b>

In order to configure and build the \cgal examples, demos, or libraries,
you need <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>, a cross-platform "makefile generator".

This manual explains only the features of CMake which are needed in order to build \cgal.
Please refer to the <a href="https://cmake.org/documentation/">CMake documentation</a>
for further details.

\attention Recent versions of CMake are needed for the most recent versions of MS Visual C++.
Please refer to CMake's documentation for further information, for example
<a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Visual%20Studio%2016%202019.html">here</a>
for Visual Studio 16 2019.

\section secessential3rdpartysoftware Essential Third Party Libraries

The focus of \cgal is on geometry, and we rely on other
highly specialized libraries and software for non-geometric issues,
for instance for numeric solvers or visualization. We first list software
that is essential to most of \cgal, and must therefore be found during the configuration of \cgal.
The page \ref configurationvariables lists CMake and environment variables which can be used to specify
the location of third-party software during configuration.

\subsection thirdpartystl Standard Template Library (STL)

\cgal heavily uses the \stl, and in particular adopted many of its design ideas. You can find online
documentation for the \stl at various web sites, for instance,
<A HREF="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">`https://en.cppreference.com `</A>,
or <A HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1fe2x6kt(v=vs.140).aspx">`https://msdn.microsoft.com`</A>.

The \stl comes with the compiler, and as such no installation is required.

\subsection thirdpartyBoost Boost
<b>Version 1.66 or later</b>

The \sc{Boost} libraries are a set of portable C++ source libraries.
Most of \sc{Boost} libraries are header-only, but a few of them need to be compiled or
installed as binaries.

\cgal only requires the headers of the \sc{Boost} libraries, but some demos and examples
depend on the binary library `Boost.Program_options`.

In case the \sc{Boost} libraries are not installed on your system already, you
can obtain them from <A HREF="https://www.boost.org">`https://www.boost.org/`</A>.
For Visual C++ you can download precompiled libraries
from <A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/">`https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/`</A>.

As there is no canonical directory for where to find \sc{Boost} on Windows,
we recommend that you define the environment variable
`BOOST_ROOT` and set it to where you have installed \sc{Boost}, e.g., `C:\boost\boost_1_69_0`.

\subsection thirdpartyMPFR GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic (GMP) and GNU Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliably (MPFR) Libraries
<b>GMP Version 4.2 or later, MPFR Version 2.2.1 or later</b>

The components `libCGAL`, `libCGAL_Core`, and `libCGAL_Qt5` require
\sc{Gmp} and \sc{Mpfr} which are libraries for multi precision integers and rational numbers,
and for multi precision floating point numbers.

\cgal combines floating point arithmetic with exact arithmetic
in order to be efficient and reliable. \cgal has a built-in
number type for that, but \sc{Gmp} and \sc{Mpfr} provide a faster
solution, and we recommend to use them.

These libraries can be obtained from <A HREF="https://gmplib.org/">`https://gmplib.org/`</A>
and <A HREF="https://www.mpfr.org/">`https://www.mpfr.org/`</A>.
Since Visual \cpp is not properly supported by the \sc{Gmp} and \sc{Mpfr} projects,
we provide precompiled versions of \sc{Gmp} and \sc{Mpfr}, which can be downloaded with the installer
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases">`CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber``-Setup.exe`</a>.

\section secoptional3rdpartysoftware Optional Third Party Libraries

Optional 3rd party software can be used by \cgal for various reasons:
certain optional libraries might be required to build examples and
demos shipped with \cgal or to build your own project using \cgal;
another reason is to speed up basic tasks where specialized libraries can be faster than the default
version shipped with \cgal.
The page \ref configurationvariables lists CMake and environment variables which can be used to specify
the location of third-party software during configuration.

\subsection thirdpartyQt Qt5
