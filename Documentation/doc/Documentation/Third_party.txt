\section seccompilers Supported Compilers

In order to build a program using \cgal, you need a \cpp compiler
supporting C++17 or later.
\cgal \cgalReleaseNumber is supported (continuously tested) for the following compilers/operating systems:

| Operating System | Compiler |

<!-- Windows supported version are also listed on windows.html (must change both) -->

Older versions of the above listed compilers might work, but no guarantee is provided.

\section seccmake CMake
<b>Version 3.22 or later</b>

In order to configure and build the \cgal examples, demos, or libraries,
you need <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>, a cross-platform "makefile generator".

This manual explains only the features of CMake which are needed in order to use \cgal.
Please refer to the <a href="https://cmake.org/documentation/">CMake documentation</a>
for further details.

\attention Recent versions of CMake are needed for the most recent versions of MS Visual C++.
Please refer to CMake's documentation for further information.

\section secessential3rdpartysoftware Essential Third Party Libraries

The focus of \cgal is on geometry, and we rely on other
highly specialized libraries and software for non-geometric issues,
for instance for numeric solvers or visualization. We first list software
that is essential to most of \cgal, and must therefore be found during the configuration of \cgal.
The page \ref configurationvariables lists CMake and environment variables which can be used to specify
the location of third-party software during configuration.

\subsection thirdpartystl Standard Template Library (STL)

\cgal heavily uses the \stl, and in particular adopted many of its design ideas. You can find online
documentation for the \stl at various web sites, for instance,
<A HREF="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">`https://en.cppreference.com `</A>,
or <A HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1fe2x6kt(v=vs.140).aspx">`https://msdn.microsoft.com`</A>.

The \stl comes with the compiler, and as such no installation is required.

\subsection thirdpartyBoost Boost
<b>Version 1.72 or later</b>

The \boost libraries are a set of portable C++ source libraries.
Most of \boost libraries are header-only, but a few of them need to be compiled or
installed as binaries.

\cgal only requires the headers of the \boost libraries, but some demos and examples
depend on the binary library `Boost.Program_options`.

In case the \boost libraries are not installed on your system already, you
can obtain them from <A HREF="https://www.boost.org">`https://www.boost.org/`</A>.
For Visual C++ you can download precompiled libraries
from <A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/">`https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/`</A>.

As there is no canonical directory for where to find \boost on Windows,
we recommend that you define the environment variable
`BOOST_ROOT` and set it to where you have installed \boost, e.g., `C:\boost\boost_1_70_0`.

\subsection thirdpartyMP Multi Precision Number Type Library

GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic (GMP) and GNU Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliably (MPFR) Libraries
are libraries for multi precision integers and rational numbers, and for multi precision floating point numbers.

These libraries can be obtained from <A HREF="https://gmplib.org/">`https://gmplib.org/`</A>
and <A HREF="https://www.mpfr.org/">`https://www.mpfr.org/`</A>.
Since Visual \cpp is not properly supported by the \gmp and \mpfr projects,
we provide precompiled versions of \gmp and \mpfr, which can be downloaded
from the <a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases">assets of a release</a>.
Version supported are <b>GMP Version 5.0.1 or later, MPFR Version 3.0.0 or later</b>.

The \boost library also provides a module for multi precision integers and rational numbers:
<A HREF="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/index.html">\boost multiprecision</A>.
Versions supported are <b>\boost Version 1.72 or later</b>.

The components \cgal, and `CGAL_Qt6` require either \gmp and \mpfr, or \boost multiprecision
for multi precision numbers. `CGAL_Core` requires \boost multiprecision.

\cgal combines floating point arithmetic with exact arithmetic
in order to be efficient and reliable. \cgal has a built-in
number type for that, but previous alternatives are faster
solutions, and we recommend using one of them.

The CMake variable `CGAL_CMAKE_EXACT_NT_BACKEND` can be used to select
the library that will be used internally for multi precision number types.

\section secoptional3rdpartysoftware Optional Third Party Libraries

Optional 3rd party software can be used by \cgal for various reasons:
certain optional libraries might be required to build examples and
demos shipped with \cgal or to build your own project using \cgal;
another reason is to speed up basic tasks where specialized libraries can be faster than the default
version shipped with \cgal.
The page \ref configurationvariables lists CMake and environment variables which can be used to specify
the location of third-party software during configuration.

\subsection thirdpartyQt Qt6
<b>Version 6.4 or later</b>

Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework.

The component `CGAL_Qt6` is essential to run the \cgal demos and basic viewers.
It requires \qt6 installed on your system.
In case \qt is not yet installed on your system, you can download
it from <A HREF="https://www.qt-project.org/">`https://www.qt-project.org/`</A>.

The exhaustive list of \qt6 components used in demos is:
`Core`, `Gui`, `Help`, `OpenGL`, `OpenGLWidgets`, `Qml`, `Svg`, `Widgets`,
`WebSockets`,  `Network`, and `qcollectiongenerator` (with `sqlite` driver plugin).

to allow the partitioning of graphs that are models of the concepts of the
<A HREF="https://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/index.html">Boost Graph Library</A>,
and, by extension, of surface meshes (see Section \ref BGLPartitioning of the package \ref PkgBGL).

\subsection thirdpartyCeres Ceres Solver

\ceres is an open source C++ library for modeling and solving large, complicated optimization problems.

Visit the official website of the library at <A HREF="http://ceres-solver.org/index.html">`ceres-solver.org`</A>
for more information.

\attention \ceres indicates that `glog` is a recommended dependency. `glog` has `libunwind` as a recommended dependency.
On some platforms, linking with `libunwind` was responsible for an increase of the runtime of the final application.
If you experience such an issue, we recommend to compile \ceres without `glog` support.
