The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (\cgal) is a software project
that provides easy access to efficient and reliable geometric algorithms
in the form of a C++ library.

<h2>Package Overview</h2>

\cgal offers data structures and algorithms like \ref PartTriangulationsAndDelaunayTriangulations "triangulations",
\ref PartVoronoiDiagrams "Voronoi diagrams", \ref PartPolygons, \ref PartPolyhedra,
\ref PartArrangements "arrangements of curves", \ref PartMeshing "mesh generation",
\ref PartGeometryProcessing "geometry processing", \ref PartConvexHullAlgorithms "convex hull algorithms",
to name just a few.

All these data structures and algorithms operate on geometric objects
like points and segments, and perform geometric tests on them. These
objects and predicates are regrouped in \ref PartKernels "CGAL Kernels".

Finally, the \ref PartSupportLibrary "Support Library" offers geometric object generators and
spatial sorting functions, as well as a matrix search framework and a
solver for linear and quadratic programs. It further offers interfaces
to third party software such as the GUI libraries Qt, and
the Boost Graph Library.

The complete list of packages is available on the page \ref packages.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
