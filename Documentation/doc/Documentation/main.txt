The goal of the \cgal Open Source Project is to provide easy access to
efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++
library. 

The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library offers data structures
and algorithms like \ref PartTriangulationsAndDelaunayTriangulations "triangulations", \ref PartVoronoiDiagrams "Voronoi diagrams",  \ref PartPolygons,  \ref PartPolyhedra, \ref PartArrangements "arrangements of curves", \ref PartMeshing "mesh generation", \ref PartGeometryProcessing "geometry processing", \ref PartConvexHullAlgorithms "convex hull algorithms", to name just
a few.

All these data structures and algorithms operate on geometric objects
like points and segments, and perform geometric tests on them. These
objects and predicates are regrouped in \ref PartKernels "CGAL Kernels".

Finally, the \ref PartSupportLibrary "Support Library" offers geometric object generators and
spatial sorting functions, as well as a matrix search framework and a
solver for linear and quadratic programs. It further offers interfaces
to third party software such as the GUI libraries Qt, Geomview, and
the Boost Graph Library.

Demos and Examples
==================

In the distribution of the library  you find the two directories *demo*
and *examples*. They contain subdirectories for the \cgal packages.  
The demos use third party libraries for the graphical user interface. The 
examples don't have this dependency and most examples are refered to in the 
user manual.
