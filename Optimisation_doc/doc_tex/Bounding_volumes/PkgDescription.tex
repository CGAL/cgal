  \ccPkgSummary{ This package
    provides algorithms for computing optimal bounding volumes of
    point sets. In d-dimensional space, the smallest enclosing sphere,
    ellipsoid (approximate), and annulus can be computed. In
    3-dimensional space, the smallest enclosing strip is available as
    well, and in 2-dimensional space, there are algorithms for a number
    of additional volumes (rectangles, parallelograms, $k=2,3,4$
    axis-aligned rectangles). The smallest enclosing
    sphere algorithm can also be applied to a set of 
    d-dimensional spheres.}
