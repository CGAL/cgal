 * `AosTopSideTraits_2` is an abstract concept. It generalizes all
 * concepts that handle curves that either reach or approach the top boundary
 * side of the parameter space.  (An "abstract" concept is a concept that is
 * useless on its own.) Only a combination of this concept and additional
 * concepts that handle curves that either reach or approach the remaining
 * boundary sides (that is, left, right, and bottom) are purposeful, and can
 * have models.
