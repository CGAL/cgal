 * `AosLeftSideTraits_2` is an abstract concept. It generalizes all
 * concepts that handle curves that either reach or approach the left boundary
 * side of the parameter space. (An "abstract" concept is a concept that is
 * useless on its own.) Only a combination of this concept and additional
 * concepts that handle curves that either reach or approach the remaining
 * boundary sides (that is, right, bottom, and top) are purposeful, and can have
 * models.
