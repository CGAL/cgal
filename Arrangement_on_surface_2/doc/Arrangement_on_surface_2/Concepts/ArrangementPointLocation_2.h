\cgalConcept

A model of the `ArrangementPointLocation_2` concept can answer point-location queries on
an arrangement attached to it. Namely, given a `Arrangement_2::Point_2`
object, representing a point in the plane, it returns the arrangement cell
containing it. In the general case, the query point is contained inside an
arrangement face, but in degenerate situations it may lie on an edge or
coincide with an arrangement vertex.

\cgalHeading{A note on Backwards compatibility}
The `locate` member function used to return `CGAL::Object` up to
\cgal version 4.2. Starting with \cgal version 4.3 the return type
is determined by a metafunction. To preserve backwards compatibility
`CGAL::Object` can be constructed from the new return types
implicitly, but switching to the new style is recommended. To enable
the old style without any overhead, the macro
`CGAL_ARR_POINT_LOCATION_VERSION` can be defined to 1 before any
\cgal header is included.
