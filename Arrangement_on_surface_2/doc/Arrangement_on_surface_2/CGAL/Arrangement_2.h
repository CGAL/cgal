 *
 * An object `arr` of the class `Arrangement_2` represents the planar
 * subdivision induced by a set of \f$ x\f$-monotone curves and isolated points
 * into maximally connected cells. The arrangement is represented as a
 * doubly-connected edge-list (\dcel) such that each \dcel vertex is associated
 * with a point of the plane and each edge is associated with an \f$
 * x\f$-monotone curve whose interior is disjoint from all other edges and
 * vertices. Recall that an arrangement edge is always comprised of a pair of
 * twin <span class="textsc">Dcel</span> halfedges.
 *
 * The `Arrangement_2` template has two parameters:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>The `Traits` template-parameter should be instantiated with
 * a model of the `ArrangementBasicTraits_2` concept. The traits
 * class defines the types of \f$ x\f$-monotone curves and two-dimensional
 * points, namely `ArrangementBasicTraits_2::X_monotone_curve_2` and
 * `ArrangementBasicTraits_2::Point_2`,
 *   respectively, and supports basic geometric predicates on them.
 * <LI>The `Dcel` template-parameter should be instantiated with
 * a class that is a model of the `ArrangementDcel` concept. The
 * value of this parameter is by default
 * `Arr_default_dcel<Traits>`.
 * </UL>
