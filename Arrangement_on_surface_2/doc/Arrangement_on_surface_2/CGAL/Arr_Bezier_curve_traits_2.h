The traits class `Arr_Bezier_curve_traits_2` is a model of the `ArrangementTraits_2`
concept that handles planar B&eacute;zier curves. A planar <I>B&eacute;zier curve</I>
\f$ B\f$ is a parametric curve defined by a sequence of <I>control points</I>
\f$ p_0, \ldots, p_n\f$ as follows:


\f{eqnarray*}{
B(t) = \left(X(t), Y(t)\right)
= \ccSum{k=0}{n}{p_k \cdot \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} \cdot
t^k (1-t)^{n-k}}\ .
\f}
where \f$ t \in [0, 1]\f$. The degree of the curve is therefore \f$ n\f$ -
namely, \f$ X(t)\f$ and \f$ Y(t)\f$ are polynomials of degree \f$ n\f$. B&eacute;zier curves
have numerous applications in computer graphics and solid modelling. They
are used, for example, in free-form sketches and for defining the true-type
fonts.

In our representation, we assume that the coordinates of all control
points are rational numbers (namely they are given as objects of the
`RatKernel::Point_2` type), so both \f$ X(t)\f$ and \f$ Y(t)\f$ are polynomials
with rational coefficients. The intersection points between curves are
however algebraic numbers, and their exact computation is time-consuming.
The traits class therefore contains a layer of geometric filtering that
performs all computation in an approximate manner whenever possible, and
it resorts to exact computations only when the approximate computation
fails to produce an unambiguous result.

We therefore require separate representations of the control points and
the intersection points. The `NtTraits` should be instantiated with a class
that defines nested `Integer`, `Rational` and `Algebraic` number
types and supports various operations on them, yielding certified computation
results (for example, in can convert rational numbers to algebraic numbers
and can compute roots of polynomials with integer coefficients).
The other template parameters, `RatKernel` and `AlgKernel` should be
geometric kernels templated with the `NtTraits::Rational` and
`NtTraits::Algebraic` number types, respectively. It is recommended to
instantiate the `CORE_algebraic_number_traits` class as the `NtTraits`
parameter, with `Cartesian<NtTraits::Rational>` and
`Cartesian<NtTraits::Algebraic>` instantiating the two kernel types,
respectively. The number types in this case are provided by the \core
library, with its ability to exactly represent simple algebraic numbers.

While `Arr_Bezier_curve_traits_2` models the concept
`ArrangementDirectionalXMonotoneTraits_2`, the implementation of
the `Are_mergeable_2` operation does not enforce the input curves
to have the same direction as a precondition. Moreover, `Arr_Bezier_curve_traits_2`
supports the merging of curves of opposite directions.

The `Point_2` class nested within the B&eacute;zier traits class is used
to represent: (i) an endpoint of a B&eacute;zier curve, (ii) a vertical tangency
point of a curve, used to subdivide it into \f$ x\f$-monotone subcurve, and
(iii) an intersection point between two curves. While, points of type (i) have
rational coordinates and are given as part of the input, points of the two
latter types have algebraic coordinates. However, to speed up the arrangement
construction, such point are not computed in an exact manner, and instead
are given in an approximate representation. Note that the exact coordinates
of a point may only be accessed if it is exactly computed.

In addition to the methods listed below, the copy constructor and assignment

The `X_monotone_curve_2` class nested within the B&eacute;zier traits is
used to represent \f$ x\f$-monotone subcurves of B&eacute;zier curves. The subcurve is
defined by a supporting B&eacute;zier curve \f$ B(t)\f$ and a range of definition in
the parameter space \f$ [t_1, t_2] \subseteq [0, 1]\f$, where \f$ B(t_1)\f$ is the
subcurve source and \f$ B(t_2)\f$ is its target. Note that as the point endpoints
may only be approximated, the parameter range defining the subcurve may
only be approximately known.

It is not possible to construct \f$ x\f$-monotone subcurves directly. Instead,
use the `Make_x_monotone_2` functor supplied by the traits class to
subdivide a `Curve_2` object into \f$ x\f$-monotone subcurves.
