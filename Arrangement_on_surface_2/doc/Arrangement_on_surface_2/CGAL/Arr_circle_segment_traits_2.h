/*! \ingroup PkgArrangementOnSurface2TraitsClasses
 *
 * The class `Arr_circle_segment_traits_2` is a model of the
 * `ArrangementTraits_2` concept and can be used to construct and maintain
 * arrangements of circular arcs and line segments.
 *
 * The traits class must be instantiated with a geometric kernel, such that the
 * supporting circles of the circular arcs are of type `Kernel::Circle_2` and
 * the supporting lines of the line segments are of type `Kernel::Line_2`.
 * Thus, the coordinates of the center of supporting circles, and its squared
 * radius are of type `Kernel::FT`, which should be an exact rational
 * number-type; similarly, the coefficients of each supporting line \f$ ax + by
 * + c = 0\f$ are also of type `Kernel::FT`. Note however that the intersection
 * point between two such arcs do not have rational coordinates in general. For
 * this reason, we do not require the endpoints of the input arcs and segments
 * to have rational coordinates.
 *
 * The nested `Point_2` type defined by the traits class is therefore
 * <I>different</I> than the `Kernel::Point_2` type. Its coordinates are of type
 * `CoordNT`, which an instantiation of `Sqrt_extension<NT,ROOT>` where `NT =
 * ROOT = Kernel::FT`.  Moreover, the third and fourth (hidden) template
 * parameters of `Sqrt_extension<NT,ROOT>` are set to `CGAL::Tag_true`, which
 * enables efficient comparison among different extensions.
 *
 * For more details see the documentation of `Sqrt_extension<NT,ROOT>`.
 *
 * While `Arr_circle_segment_traits_2` models the concept
 * `ArrangementDirectionalXMonotoneTraits_2`, the implementation of the
 * `Are_mergeable_2` operation does not enforce the input curves to have the
 * same direction as a precondition. Moreover, `Arr_circle_segment_traits_2`
 * supports the merging of curves of opposite directions.
