 *
 * An object `arr` of the class `Arrangement_on_surface_with_history_2`
 * represents the planar subdivision induced by a set of input curves \f$ \cal
 * C\f$.  The arrangement is represented as a doubly-connected edge-list (<span
 * class="textsc">Dcel</span>).  As is the case for the
 * `Arrangement_2<Traits,Dcel>`, each <span class="textsc">Dcel</span> vertex is
 * associated with a point and each edge is associated with an \f$ x\f$-monotone
 * curve whose interior is disjoint from all other edges and vertices. Each such
 * \f$ x\f$-monotone curve is a subcurve of some \f$ C \in \cal C\f$ - or may
 * represent an overlap among several curves in \f$ \cal C\f$.
 *
 * The `Arrangement_on_surface_with_history_2` class-template extends the
 * `Arrangement_2` class-template by keeping an additional container of input
 * curves representing \f$ \cal C\f$, and by maintaining a cross-mapping between
 * these curves and the arrangement edges they induce. This way it is possible
 * to determine the inducing curve(s) of each arrangement edge. This mapping
 * also allows the traversal of input curves, and the traversal of edges induced
 * by each curve.
 *
 * The `Arrangement_on_surface_with_history_2` template has two parameters:
 *
 * <UL>
 * <LI>The `GeometryTraits` template-parameter should be instantiated with a
 * model of the `ArrangementTraits_2` concept. The traits class defines the
 * `Curve_2` type, which represents an input curve.  It also defines the types
 * of \f$ x\f$-monotone curves and two-dimensional points, namely
 * `ArrangementTraits_2::X_monotone_curve_2` and
 * `ArrangementTraits_2::Point_2`, respectively, and supports basic
 * geometric predicates on them.
 * <LI>The `Dcel` template-parameter should be instantiated with a class that is
 * a model of the `ArrangementDcelWithRebind` concept. The value of this
 * parameter is by default `Arr_default_dcel<Traits>`.
 * </UL>
