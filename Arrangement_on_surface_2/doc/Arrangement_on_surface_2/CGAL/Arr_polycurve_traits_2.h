  /*! \ingroup PkgArrangementOnSurface2TraitsClasses
   *
   * Note: The `SubcurveTraits_2` can comprise of Line_segments, Conic_arcs,
   *       Circular_arc, Bezier_curves, or Linear_curves. A portion or a part
   *       of any of the above mentioned geometric traits is called a subcurve.
   *
   * The traits class `Arr_polycurve_traits_2` handles piecewise curves that are
   * not necessarily linear, such as conic arcs, circular arcs, Bezier curves,
   * or line segments. We call such a compound curve a polycurve.  A polycurve
   * is a chain of subcurves, where each two neighboring subcurves in the chain
   * share a common endpoint; that is, the polycurve is continuous. Furthermore,
   * the target of the \f$i\f$th segement of a polycurve has to coincide with
   * the source of the \f$i+1\f$st segment; that is, the polycurve has to be
   * \a well-oriented. Note that it is possible to construct general polycurves
   * that are neither continuous nor well-oriented, as it is impossible to
   * enforce this precondition (using the set of predicates required by the
   * relevant concepts, see below). However, such polycurves cannot be used for
   * the actual computation of arrangements. The traits class template exploits
   * the functionality of the `SubcurveTraits_2` template-parameter to handle
   * the subcurves that compose the polycurve.
   *
   * The type substituting the template parameter `SubcurveTraits_2` when
   * the template Arr_polycurve_traits_2 is instantiated must be a model
   * of the concepts
   *   - `ArrangementTraits_2` and
   *   - `ArrangementDirectionalXMonotoneTraits_2`.
   *
   * If, in addition, the SubcurveTraits_2 models the concept
   * `ArrangementApproximateTraits_2` then `Arr_polycurve_traits_2` models this
   * concept as well. The same holds for the concept
   * `ArrangementOpenBoundaryTraits_2`. If no type is provided, then
   * `Arr_segment_traits_2` (instantiated with
   * `Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel` as the kernel) is used.
   * Otherwise,
   * `Arr_algebraic_segment_traits_2<Coefficient>`,
   * `Arr_Bezier_curve_traits_2<RatKernel, AlgKernel, NtTraits>`,
   * `Arr_circle_segment_traits_2<Kernel>`,
   * `Arr_conic_traits_2<RatKernel, AlgKernel, NtTraits>`,
   * `Arr_linear_traits_2<Kernel>`,
   * `Arr_non_caching_segment_traits_2<Kernel>`,
   * `Arr_segment_traits_2<Kernel>`,
   * `Arr_rational_function_traits_2<AlgebraicKernel_d_1>`,
   * or any other model of the concepts above can be used.
   *
   * The number type used by the injected subcurve traits should support exact
   * rational arithmetic (that is, the number type should support the arithmetic
   * operations \f$ +\f$, \f$ -\f$, \f$ \times\f$ and \f$ \div\f$ carried out
   * without loss of precision), in order to avoid robustness problems, although
   * other inexact number types could be used at the user's own risk.
   *
   * A polycurve that comprises \f$n > 0\f$ subcurves has \f$ n+1 \f$ subcurve
   * end-points, and they are represented as objects of type
   * `SubcurveTraits_2::Point_2`. Since the notion of a \a vertex is reserved to
   * 0-dimensional elements of an arrangement, we use, in this context, the
   * notion of \a points in order to refer to the vertices of a polycurve. For
   * example, an arrangement induced by a single non-self intersecting polycurve
   * has exactly two vertices regardless of the number of subcurve
   * end-points. Finally, the types `Subcurve_2` and `X_monotone_subcurve_2`
   * nested in `Arr_polycurve_traits_2` are nothing but
   * `SubcurveTraits_2::Curve_2` and `SubcurveTraits_2::X_monotone_curve_2`,
   * respectively.
   *
   * \cgalHeading{A note on Backwards compatibility} In \cgal version 4.2 (and
   * earlier) any object of the `X_monotone_curve_2` type nested in
   * `Arr_polycurve_traits_2` which in that version was called
   * `Arr_polyline_tratis_2` maintained a direction invariant; namely, its
   * vertices were ordered in an \a ascending lexicographical \f$(xy)\f$-order.
   * This restriction is no longer imposed and `X_monotone_curve_2` can be now
   * directed either from right-to-left \a or left-to-right. If you wish to
   * maintain a left-to-right orientations of the \f$x\f$-monotone polycurve,
   * set the macro `CGAL_ALWAYS_LEFT_TO_RIGHT` to 1 before any \cgal header is
   * included.
