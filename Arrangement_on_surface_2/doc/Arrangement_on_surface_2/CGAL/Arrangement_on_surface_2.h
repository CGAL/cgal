 * An object `aos` of the class `Arrangement_on_surface_2` represents the
 * subdivision induced by a set of \f$ x\f$-monotone curves and isolated points
 * into maximally connected cells. The arrangement is represented as a
 * doubly-connected edge-list (<span class="textsc">Dcel</span>) such that each
 * <span class="textsc">Dcel</span> vertex is associated with a point of the
 * plane and each edge is associated with an \f$ x\f$-monotone curve whose
 * interior is disjoint from all other edges and vertices. Recall that an
 * arrangement edge is always comprised of a pair of twin <span
 * class="textsc">Dcel</span> halfedges.

 * The `Arrangement_on_surface_2` template has two parameters:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>The `GeometryTraits` template-parameter should be instantiated with
 * a model of a geometry traits. The minimal requirements are defined by the
 * `ArrangementBasicTraits_2` concept. A model of this concept defines
 * the types of \f$ x\f$-monotone curves and two-dimensional points, namely
 * `ArrangementBasicTraits_2::X_monotone_curve_2` and
 * `ArrangementBasicTraits_2::Point_2`, respectively, and supports basic
 * geometric predicates on them.
 * <LI>The `TopologyTraits` template-parameter should be instantiated with a
 * class that is a model of the `ArrangementTopologyTraits` concept.
 * </UL>
 *
 * The available traits classes and <span class="textsc">Dcel</span> classes are

 * Removes an edge given by one of the twin halfedges that forms it, from a
 * given arrangement. Once the edge is removed, if the vertices associated with
 * its endpoints become isolated, they are removed as well. The call
 * `remove_edge(arr, e)` is equivalent to the call `arr.remove_edge (e, true,
 * true)`. However, this free function requires that `Traits` be a model of the
 * refined concept `ArrangementXMonotoneTraits_2`, which requires merge
 * operations on \f$ x\f$-monotone curves. If one of the end-vertices of the
 * given edge becomes redundant after the edge is removed (see `remove_vertex()`
 * for the definition of a redundant vertex), it is removed, and its incident
 * edges are merged.  If the edge-removal operation causes two faces to merge,
 * the merged face is returned. Otherwise, the face to which the edge was
 * incident before the removal is returned.
