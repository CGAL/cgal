 *
 * An object `arr` of the class `Arrangement_with_history_2` represents the
 * planar subdivision induced by a set of input curves \f$ \cal C\f$.  The
 * arrangement is represented as a doubly-connected edge-list (\dcel).  As is
 * the case for the `Arrangement_2<Traits,Dcel>`, each \dcel vertex is
 * associated with a point and each edge is associated with an \f$ x\f$-monotone
 * curve whose interior is disjoint from all other curves and points. Each such
 * \f$ x\f$-monotone curve is a subcurve of some \f$ C \in \cal C\f$, or may
 * represent an overlap among several curves in \f$ \cal C\f$.
 *
 * The `Arrangement_with_history_2` class-template extends the `Arrangement_2`
 * class-template by keeping an additional container of input curves
 * representing \f$ \cal C\f$, and by maintaining a cross-mapping between these
 * curves and the arrangement edges they induce. This way it is possible to
 * determine the inducing curve(s) of each arrangement edge. This mapping also
 * allows the traversal of input curves, and the traversal of edges induced by
 * each curve.
 *
 * The `Arrangement_with_history_2` template has two parameters:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>The `Traits` template-parameter should be instantiated with a model of
 * the `ArrangementTraits_2` concept. The traits class defines the `Curve_2`
 * type, which represents an input curve.  It also defines the types of \f$
 * x\f$-monotone curves and two-dimensional points, namely
 * `ArrangementTraits_2::X_monotone_curve_2` and `ArrangementTraits_2::Point_2`,
 * respectively, and supports basic geometric predicates on them.
 * <LI>The `Dcel` template-parameter should be instantiated with a class that is
 * a model of the `ArrangementDcelWithRebind` concept. The value of this
 * parameter is by default `Arr_default_dcel<Traits>`.
 * </UL>
 *
 * \sa `ArrangementDcel`
 * \sa `Arr_default_dcel<Traits>`
 * \sa `ArrangementTraits_2`
 * \sa `Arrangement_2<Traits,Dcel>`
 * \sa `insertion functions`
 * \sa `removal functions`
 * \sa `overlaying arrangements`
