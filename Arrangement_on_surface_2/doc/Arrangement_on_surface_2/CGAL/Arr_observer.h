 * `Arr_observer` serves as an abstract base class for all observer classes that
 * are attached to an arrangement instance of type `Arrangement` and receive
 * notifications from the arrangement.  This base class handles the attachment
 * of the observer to a given arrangement instance or to the detachment of the
 * observer from this arrangement instance. It also gives a default empty
 * implementation to all notification functions that are invoked by the
 * arrangement to notify the observer on local or global changes it undergoes.
 * The notification functions are all virtual functions, so they can be
 * overridden by the concrete observer classes that inherit from `Arr_observer`.
 *
 * In order to implement a concrete arrangement observer-class, one simply needs
 * to derive from `Arr_observer` and override the relevant notification
 * functions. For example, if only face-split events are of interest, it is
 * sufficient to override just `before_split_face()` (or just
 * `after_split_face()`).
