\section*{Design and Implementation History}
%===========================================

The code of this package is the result of a long development process.
Initially (and until version~3.1), the code was spread among several
packages, namely \ccc{Topological_map}, \ccc{Planar_map_2},
\ccc{Planar_map_with_intersections_2} and \ccc{Arrangement_2}, that were
developed by~: \newline
Ester Ezra, Eyal Flato, Efi Fogel, Dan Halperin, Iddo Hanniel, Idit Haran,
Shai Hirsch, Eugene Lipovetsky, Oren Nechushtan, Sigal Raab, Ron Wein,
Baruch Zukerman, and Tali Zvi.

In version~3.2, as part of the ACS project, the packages have gone through
a major re-design, resulting in an improved \ccc{Arrangement_2} package.
The code of the new package was restructured and developed by~: \newline
Efi Fogel, Idit Haran, Ron Wein, and Baruch Zukerman.

Version~3.3 features arrangements of unbounded curves at the first
time. The design and development of this feature was greatly assisted
by Eric Berberich.
