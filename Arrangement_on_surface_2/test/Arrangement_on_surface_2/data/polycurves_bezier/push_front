# Push_front for polycurves have 2 types of operators. It can either push a segment into a polycurve or
# it can push an x-monotone segment into an x-monotone polycurve
#
# Format:
# <command> <type of operator 0 for curve, 1 for x-curve (mentioned abve)> <polycurve/x-polycurve id> 
# <segment/x-segment to be pushed (6 coefficients, orientation, source point target point)> <Expectec curve/x_curve id>
