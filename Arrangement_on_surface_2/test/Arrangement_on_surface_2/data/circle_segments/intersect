# Input is based on the curves and points indexes from intersect.pt 
# intersect.xcv. The first two numbers are the numbers of the input curves
# to be intersected. After that there is the number of intersections and 
# 2-3 numbers representing each intersection. Meaning, the input is of the form:
# intersect <id of 1st x-curve> <id of 2nd x-curve> \
# <expected number of intersections> [<type of intersection> \
# <id of output> <multiplicity>]*
#
# * for each intersection
# type: 0 - point, 1 - x-monotone curve
#
# Intersection is an internal point:
intersect 0 1 1 0 0 1
intersect 1 0 1 0 0 1
# Intersection is an end point:
intersect 0 2 1 0 1 1
intersect 2 0 1 0 1 1
# Intersection is an x-monotone curve:
intersect 2 3 1 1 4
intersect 3 2 1 1 4
# Intersection is an x-monotone curve stricktly contained in an input curve: 
intersect 4 5 1 1 4
intersect 5 4 1 1 4
intersect 6 8 2 0 4 1 0 2 1
intersect 7 8 2 0 4 1 0 2 1
intersect 6 9 1 0 3 1
intersect 7 9 1 0 5 1
intersect 6 10 1 0 3 2
intersect 7 11 1 0 5 2
# Bug when intersecting two curves on the same supporting only touching end pt.
intersect 12 13 1 0 2 0
