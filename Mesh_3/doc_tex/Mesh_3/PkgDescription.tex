\ccPkgSummary{
This package is devoted to the generation of  isotropic simplicial
meshes discretizing 3D domains.
The domain to be meshed is a region of 3D space that has to be bounded.
The region may be connected or  composed of multiple components
and/or subdivided in several subdomains. 
The domain is input as an oracle able to answer
 queries, of a few different types, on the domain.
Boundary and subdivision surfaces  are either
smooth or piecewise smooth surfaces, formed with planar or curved surface patches.
Surfaces may exhibit 1-dimensional features (e.g. crease edges)
and 0-dimensional features (e.g. singular points as corners
 tips, cusps or darts), that have to be fairly
approximated in the mesh.
The output mesh is a 3-dimensional triangulation, 
including subcomplexes that approximate each input domain feature: subdomain,
boundary surface patch or input domain feature with dimension~0 or~1.
Thus,  the output mesh includes  a 3D submesh covering each  subdomain, 
a surface mesh approximating  each boundary or subdividing
surface patch, a polyline approximation for  each 
1-dimensional feature and 
of course  a vertex on each  corner. }
