\deprecated The class template `Gray_image_mesh_domain_3` is deprecated
since CGAL-4.13, in favor of the class template `Labeled_mesh_domain_3` and
its static function
`Labeled_mesh_domain_3::create_gray_image_mesh_domain()`.

The class `Gray_image_mesh_domain_3` implements a domain described by a 3D
gray image. A 3D gray image is a grid of voxels,
where each voxel is associated with a gray level value.
This class is a model of the concept `MeshDomain_3`.
The domain to be discretized is the union of voxels that lie inside a surface
described by an isolevel value, called \a isovalue. The voxels lying inside the
domain have gray level values that are larger than the isovalue.

This class includes a member function that provides, by interpolation,
a gray level value at any query point.
An intersection between a segment and bounding
surfaces is detected when both segment endpoints are associated with gray level
values which are on both sides of the isovalue.
The intersection is then constructed by bisection.
The bisection stops when the query segment is shorter than a given error bound
`e`. This error bound is given by `e=d`\f$ \times\f$`bound` where `d` is the
length of the diagonal of the bounding box (in world coordinates) and
`bound` is the argument passed to the constructor of `Labeled_image_mesh_domain_3`.


\tparam Image is the type of the input image.
This parameter must be `CGAL::Image_3`.

\tparam BGT is a geometric traits class which provides
the basic operations to implement
intersection tests and intersection computations
through a bisection method. This parameter must be instantiated
with a model of the concept `BisectionGeometricTraits_3`.

\tparam Image_word_type is the data type encoded in the `Image`
input file
