The concept `MeshPolyline_3` implements a container of points designed to represent a polyline (i.e.\ a sequence of points).
Types and functions provided in this concept are such as standard template library containers
are natural models of this concept.

\cgalHasModel `std::vector<Kernel::Point_3>` for any Kernel of \cgal is a natural model of this concept.
