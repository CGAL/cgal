The concept `MeshDomain_3` describes the knowledge required on the
object to be discretized.
The concept `MeshDomain_3` is the concept to be used when the input
domain does not have \f$ 0\f$ or \f$ 1\f$-dimensional features that need to be
accurately approximated by the mesh.
In such a case, the queries issued by the meshing process concern only the faces of the input domain with dimension \f$ 3\f$
and \f$ 2\f$, that are respectively called <I>subdomains</I> and <I>surface patches</I>.

More specifically the concept `MeshDomain_3` provides
a method to localize a point with respect to the input domain
and its subdomains.
Moreover, as the concept `SurfaceMeshTraits_3`,
it also provides
predicates to test whether a query segment
(or a ray, or a line) intersects the boundary of the domain or
of the subdomains, and constructors
to compute some intersection point if any.
It also includes a method able to provide
a small set of initial points on the boundary.

In the following we consider only proper intersection with the domain and
subdomain boundaries.
A segment, ray or line is said to intersect properly the domain boundary
(resp. a subdomain boundary)
if it includes points which are strictly inside
and strictly outside the domain (resp. the subdomain).
