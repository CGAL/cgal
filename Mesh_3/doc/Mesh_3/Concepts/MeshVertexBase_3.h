The concept `MeshVertexBase_3` describes the requirements
for the `Vertex` type of the triangulation
used by a 3D mesh generation process. The type `MeshVertexBase_3` refines
the concepts `RegularTriangulationVertexBase_3`,
`SimplicialMeshVertexBase_3`, and `SurfaceMeshVertexBase_3`.
It provides additional members to store and retrieve
information about the location of the vertex with respect
to the input domain describing the domain to be discretized.
More specifically, the concept `MeshVertexBase_3` provides read-write access
to an integer representing the dimension of the lowest dimensional face
of the input 3D complex on which the vertex lies,
and to an index characteristic of this face.
The concept `MeshVertexBase_3` provides storage and read-write access to a boolean, a `FT` value,
and two `Vertex_handle` called 'intrusive'.

The parallel algorithms require an erase counter in
each cell (see below).
