The concept `IntersectionGeometricTraits_3` provides types and functors
required to implement a model of `MeshDomain_3`,
when the domain is described by a simplicial surface mesh
forming its boundary.
The concept `IntersectionGeometricTraits_3` mainly provides the detection
and construction of intersections between segments and triangles.

\cgalHasModel All models of the `Kernel` concept.
