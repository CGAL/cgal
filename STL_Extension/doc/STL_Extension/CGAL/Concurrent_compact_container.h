\ingroup CompactContainer

The traits class `Concurrent_compact_container_traits` provides
the way to access the internal pointer required for `T` to be
used in a `Concurrent_compact_container<T, Allocator>`. Note that this
pointer needs to be accessible even when the object is not constructed,
which means it has to reside in the same memory place as `T`.

You can specialize this class for your own type `T`
if the default template is not suitable.

You can also use `Compact_container_base` as base class for your own
types `T` to make them usable with the default `Concurrent_compact_container`.

\cgalHeading{Parameters}

`T` is any type providing the following member functions:
`void * t.for_compact_container() const;`
`void t.for_compact_container(void *);`.

/*!
\ingroup CompactContainer

An object of the class `Concurrent_compact_container`
is a container of objects of type `T`, which allows to call
`insert` and `erase` operations concurrently.
Other operations are not concurrency-safe.
For example, one should not parse the container while others are modifying it.
It matches all the
standard requirements for reversible containers, except that
the complexity of its iterator increment and decrement operations
is not always guaranteed to be amortized constant time.

This container is not a standard <I>sequence</I> nor <I>associative</I> container,
which means the elements are stored in no particular order, and it is not
possible to specify a particular place in the iterator sequence where to
insert new objects. However, all dereferenceable iterators are
still valid after calls to `insert()` and `erase()`, except those
that have been erased (it behaves similarly to `std::list`).

The main feature of this container is that it is very memory efficient:
its memory size is `N*sizeof(T)+o(N)`, where `N` is the maximum size
that the container has had in its past history, its `capacity()`
(the memory of erased elements is not deallocated until destruction of the
container or a call to `clear()`). This container has been developed in
order to store large graph-like data structures like the triangulation and
the halfedge data structures.

It supports bidirectional iterators and allows a constant time amortized
`insert()` operation. You cannot specify where to insert new objects
(i.e.\ you don't know where they will end up in the iterator sequence,
although `insert()` returns an iterator pointing to the newly inserted
object). You can erase any element with a constant time complexity.

Summary of the differences with `std::list`: it is more compact in
memory since it doesn't store two additional pointers for the iterator needs.
It doesn't deallocate elements until the destruction or `clear()` of the
container. The iterator does not have constant amortized time complexity for
the increment and decrement operations in all cases, only when not too many
elements have not been freed (i.e.\ when the `size()` is close to the
`capacity()`). Iterating from `begin()` to `end()` takes
`O(capacity())` time, not `size()`. In the case where the container
has a small `size()` compared to its `capacity()`, we advise to
\"defragment the memory\" by copying the container if the iterator performance
is needed.

The iterators themselves can be used as `T`, they provide the necessary
functions to be used by `Compact_container_traits<T>`. Moreover, they
also provide a default constructor value which is not singular: it is
copyable, comparable, and guaranteed to be unique under comparison
(like `NULL` for pointers). This makes them suitable for use in
geometric graphs like handles to vertices in triangulations.

In addition, in a way inspired from the Boost.Intrusive containers, it is
possible to construct iterators from references to values in containers
using the `iterator_to` and `s_iterator_to` functions.

The objects stored in the `Concurrent_compact_container` can optionally store an
"erase counter". If it exists, i.e.\ if the object is a model of the
`ObjectWithEraseCounter` concept, each time an object is erased from the
container, the erase counter of the object will be incremented.
For example, this erase counter can be exploited using the `CC_safe_handle`
helper class, so that one can know if a handle is still pointing to the same
element.
Note that this is meaningful only because the
`CGAL::Concurrent_compact_container` doesn't
deallocate elements until the destruction or clear() of the container.

\cgalHeading{Parameters}

The parameter `T` is required to have a copy constructor and an
assignment operator. It also needs to provide access to an internal
pointer via `Compact_container_traits<T>`.

The equality test and the relational order require the operators
`==` and `<` for `T` respectively.

The parameter `Allocator` has to match the standard allocator
requirements, with value type `T`. This parameter has the default
value `CGAL_ALLOCATOR(T)`.
