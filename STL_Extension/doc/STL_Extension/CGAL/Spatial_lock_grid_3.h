The class `Spatial_lock_grid_3` allows to lock
points with coordinates (x, y, z) in a 3D grid.
The point type is called `P3` here. `P3` must provide x(), y(), and z() functions,
returning the respective point coordinates as numbers whose type is a
model of the concept of `RealEmbeddable`.

It is a model of `SurjectiveLockDataStructure`, with `T` being
`P3` and `S` being the function that maps a point to
the cell of the 3D grid containing this point.

For example, it can be used by concurrent algorithms to lock simplices.

\tparam Grid_lock_tag allows to choose the locking strategy used by the
structure. The following tags are available:
- `Tag_non_blocking` is non-blocking (i.e.\ try_lock will always
return immediately) and uses atomics to perform lock operations.
- `Tag_priority_blocking` provides both non-blocking and
partially-blocking `try_lock` versions. The partially-blocking version will
block (spin) if the thread owning the lock has a lower \"ID\" (each thread is
given an arbitrary ID) or return immediately otherwise. It uses atomics to
perform lock operations.
