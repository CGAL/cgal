The concept `SurjectiveLockDataStructure` describes functionalities
of a data structure whose goal is to lock
objects in a multi-threaded environment.
Such data structures are intended to be used by concurrent
algorithms.

Note that it is allowed to \"lock too much\". E.g., the data structure
might be a voxel grid and locking a point might be locking the
voxel containing this point.
Thus, a point may also be locked because
another point in the same voxel has been locked.
The only requirement is that when a thread owns the lock of an object, no other
thread can lock the same object.

We call `S` the surjective function such that `S(object)`
is the \"thing\" that is locked when one tries to lock `object`.
In the previous example, `S(point)` is the voxel containing `point`.
