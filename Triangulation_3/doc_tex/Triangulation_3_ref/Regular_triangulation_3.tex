\ccDefinition
  Let ${S}^{(w)}$ be a set of weighted points in $\R^3$. Let
${p}^{(w)}=(p,w_p), p\in\R^3, w_p\in\R$ and 
${z}^{(w)}=(z,w_z), z\in\R^3, w_z\in\R$ be two weighted points. 
A weighted point
${p}^{(w)}=(p,w_p)$ can also be seen as a sphere of center $p$ and
radius $\sqrt{w_p}$. 
The \textit{power product} (or  \textit{power distance} ) 
between ${p}^{(w)}$ and ${z}^{(w)}$ is
defined as 
\[\Pi({p}^{(w)},{z}^{(w)}) = {\|{p-z}\|^2-w_p-w_z}\]
where $\|{p-z}\|$ is the Euclidean distance between $p$ and $z$. 
 ${p}^{(w)}$ and ${z}^{(w)}$
are said to be \textit{orthogonal} if $\Pi{({p}^{(w)}-{z}^{(w)})}
= 0$ (see Figure~\ref{Triangulation3-fig-ortho}).

Four weighted points have a unique common orthogonal weighted point called
the \textit{power sphere}. A sphere ${z}^{(w)}$ is said to be
\textit{regular} if $\forall {p}^{(w)}\in{S}^{(w)},
\Pi{({p}^{(w)}-{z}^{(w)})}\geq 0$.

A triangulation of ${S}^{(w)}$ is \textit{regular} if the power spheres
of all simplices are regular.

\ccOperations


\ccHeading{Insertion}
\ccThree{OutputIterator}{dt.insertxx}{}

The following methods, which already exist in \ccc{Triangulation_3}, are
overloaded to ensure the property that all power spheres are regular.

\ccMethod{Vertex_handle insert(const Weighted_point & p,
                               Cell_handle start = Cell_handle() );}
{Inserts weighted point \ccc{p} in the triangulation. The optional 
argument \ccc{start} is used as a starting place for the search.\\
If this insertion creates a vertex, this vertex is returned.\\
If \ccc{p} coincides with an existing vertex and has a greater weight, 
then the existing weighted point becomes hidden (see 
\ccc{RegularTriangulationCellBase_3}) and \ccc{p} replaces it as vertex 
of the triangulation.\\
If \ccc{p} coincides with an already existing vertex (both point and 
weights being equal), then this vertex is returned and the triangulation 
remains unchanged.\\
Otherwise if \ccc{p} does not appear as a vertex of the triangulation, 
then it is stored as a hidden point and this method returns the default 
constructed handle.}

\ccMethod{Vertex_handle insert(const Weighted_point & p, Vertex_handle hint);}
{ Same as above but uses \ccc{hint} as a starting place for the search. }

\ccMethod{Vertex_handle insert(const Weighted_point & p, Locate_type lt,
                               Cell_handle loc, int li, int lj);}
{Inserts weighted point \ccc{p} in the triangulation and returns the corresponding
 vertex. Similar to the above \ccc{insert()} function, but takes as additional
 parameter the return values of a previous location query.  See description of
 \ccc{Triangulation_3::locate()}.}

The following method allows one to insert several points.

\ccMethod{template < class InputIterator >
          std::ptrdiff_t
          insert(InputIterator first, InputIterator last);}
{Inserts the weighted points in the range $\left[\right.$\ccc{first},
\ccc{last}$\left.\right)$. 
Note that this function is not guaranteed to insert the points
following the order of \ccc{InputIterator}.
It returns the difference of the number of vertices between after and
before the insertions (it may be negative due to hidden points).
\ccPrecond{The \ccc{value_type} of \ccc{first} and \ccc{last} is
\ccc{Weighted_point}.}}

The following methods, which already exist in \ccc{Triangulation_3}, are
overloaded to ensure that hidden points are well created and maintained.

\ccMethod{template <class CellIt>
     Vertex_handle insert_in_hole(Weighted_point p, CellIt cell_begin, CellIt cell_end,
	                          Cell_handle begin, int i);}
{Creates a new vertex by starring a hole.  It takes an iterator range
[\ccc{cell_begin}; \ccc{cell_end}[ of \ccc{Cell_handle}s which specifies
a hole: a set of connected cells (resp. facets in dimension 2) which is
star-shaped wrt \ccc{p}.
(\ccc{begin}, \ccc{i}) is a facet (resp. an edge) on the boundary of the hole,
that is, \ccc{begin} belongs to the set of cells (resp.  facets) previously
described, and \ccc{begin->neighbor(i)} does not.  Then this function deletes
all the cells (resp. facets) describing the hole, creates a new vertex
\ccc{v}, and for each facet (resp. edge) on the boundary of the hole, creates
a new cell (resp. facet) with \ccc{v} as vertex.  Then \ccc{v->set_point(p)}
is called and \ccc{v} is returned.\\
If the hole contains interior vertices, each of them is hidden by the insertion
of \ccc{p} and is stored in the new cell which contains it.
\ccPrecond{\ccVar.\ccc{dimension()} $\geq 2$, the set of cells (resp. facets in
dimension 2) is connected, not empty, its boundary is connected, and \ccc{p}
lies inside the hole, which is star-shaped wrt \ccc{p}}.}

\ccMethod{template <class CellIt>
     Vertex_handle insert_in_hole(Weighted_point p, CellIt cell_begin, CellIt cell_end,
	                          Cell_handle begin, int i, Vertex_handle newv);}
{ Same as above, except that \ccc{newv} will be used as the new vertex, which
  must have been allocated previously with e.g. \ccc{create_vertex}.}


\ccHeading{Removal}

\ccMethod{void remove(Vertex_handle v);}
{Removes the vertex \ccc{v} from the triangulation.}

\ccHeading{Queries}
\ccThree{OutputIterator}{rt.side of powerxx}{}

Let us remark that 
\[\Pi({p}^{(w)}-{z}^{(w)}) > 0\]
is equivalent to\\
\centerline{\ccc{p} lies outside the sphere with center \ccc{z} and radius
$\sqrt{w_p^2+w_z^2}$.}\\
This remark helps provide an intuition about the following predicates.

${z(c)}^{(w)}$ is the power sphere of \ccc{c}. For an
infinite cell this means either that \ccc{p} lies strictly in the half

of the triangulation, or that the angle 
between \ccc{p} and the power circle of the \textit{finite} facet of \ccc{c}
is greater than $\pi/2$. \\

i.e. the angle between the weighted point \ccc{p} and the power sphere
of \ccc{c} is less than $\pi/2$ or if these two spheres do not
intersect. For an

two previous conditions.

A  weighted point \ccc{p} is said to be in conflict 
with a cell \ccc{c} in dimension 3

\ccc{p} is connected.

In the weighted setting, a face (cell, facet, edge or vertex) 
is said to be a Gabriel face iff
the  smallest sphere  orthogonal to the weighted 
points associated to its vertices,
has a positive power product with the weighted point
of any other vertex of the triangulation.
Any weighted Gabriel face belongs to the
regular triangulation, but the reciprocal is not true.
The following member functions test the Gabriel property of the
faces of the regular triangulation.
