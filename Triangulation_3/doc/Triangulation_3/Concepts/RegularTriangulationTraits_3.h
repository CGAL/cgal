\cgalConcept

The concept `RegularTriangulationTraits_3` is the first template parameter of the class
`CGAL::Regular_triangulation_3`. It defines the geometric objects (points,
segments...) forming the triangulation together with a few geometric
predicates and constructions on these objects.

We use here the same notation as in Section \ref
Triangulation3secclassRegulartriangulation. To simplify notation, \f$
p\f$ will often denote in the sequel either the point \f$ p\in\mathbb{R}^3\f$
or the weighted point \f$ {p}^{(w)}=(p,w_p)\f$.

\cgalRefines `TriangulationTraits_3`

\cgalHasModel All models of `Kernel`.

\sa `CGAL::Regular_triangulation_3`

In addition to the requirements described for the traits class of
  `CGAL::Triangulation_3`, the geometric traits class of
  `CGAL::Regular_triangulation_3` must fulfill the following requirements.

\note The unweighted point type `Point_3` is requested by the concept
`TriangulationTraits_3`, which this concept refines.
*/
typedef unspecified_type Weighted_point_3;

/*!
A predicate object,
model of `Kernel::PowerSideOfOrientedPowerSphere_3`,
that must provide the following function operators:

`Oriented_side operator()( Weighted_point_3 p,                          Weighted_point_3 q,                          Weighted_point_3 r,                          Weighted_point_3 s,                          Weighted_point_3 t)`,

which performs the following:

Let \f$ {z(p,q,r,s)}^{(w)}\f$ be the power sphere of the weighted points
\f$ (p,q,r,s)\f$. Returns

- `ON_ORIENTED_BOUNDARY` if `t` is orthogonal to
  \f$ {z(p,q,r,s)}^{(w)}\f$,

- `ON_NEGATIVE_SIDE` if `t` lies outside the oriented sphere of
  center \f$ z(p,q,r,s)\f$ and radius \f$ \sqrt{ w_{z(p,q,r,s)}^2 + w_t^2 }\f$
  (which is equivalent to \f$ \Pi({t}^{(w)},{z(p,q,r,s)}^{(w)}) >0\f$),

- `ON_POSITIVE_SIDE` if `t` lies inside this oriented sphere.

\pre `p, q, r, s` are not coplanar.
Note that with this definition, if all the points have a weight equal
to 0, then
`power_side_of_oriented_power_sphere_3(p,q,r,s,t)` = `side_of_oriented_sphere(p,q,r,s,t)`.

<HR WIDTH=50%>

`Oriented_side operator()( Weighted_point_3 p,                          Weighted_point_3 q,                          Weighted_point_3 r,                          Weighted_point_3 t)`,

which has a
definition analogous to the previous method, for coplanar points,
with the power circle \f$ {z(p,q,r)}^{(w)}\f$.
\pre `p, q, r` are not collinear and `p, q, r, t` are coplanar.
If all the points have a weight equal to 0, then
`power_side_of_oriented_power_sphere_3(p,q,r,t)` = `side_of_oriented_circle(p,q,r,t)`.

<HR WIDTH=50%>

`Oriented_side operator()( Weighted_point_3 p,                          Weighted_point_3 q,                          Weighted_point_3 t)`,

which is the same for collinear points, where \f$ {z(p,q)}^{(w)}\f$ is the
power segment of `p` and `q`.
\pre `p` and `q` have different bare points, and `p, q, t` are collinear.
If all points have a weight equal to 0, then
`power_side_of_oriented_power_sphere_3(p,q,t)` gives the same answer as the kernel predicate
`s(p,q).has_on(t)` would give, where `s(p,q)` denotes the
segment with endpoints `p` and `q`.

<HR WIDTH=50%>

`Oriented_side operator()( Weighted_point_3 p, Weighted_point_3 q)`,

which is the same for equal bare points, then it returns the comparison of the weights
(`ON_POSITIVE_SIDE` when `q` is heavier than `p`).
\pre `p` and `q` have equal bare points.
