\cgalRefines{SpatialSortingTraits_3}

The concept `TriangulationTraits_3` is the first template parameter of the class
`Triangulation_3`. It defines the geometric objects (points, segments,
triangles and tetrahedra) forming the triangulation together with a few
geometric predicates and constructions on these objects: lexicographical
comparison, orientation in case of coplanar points and orientation in space.

\cgalHasModel All models of `Kernel`.

internally manipulates points with a `Point` type that is not always `Point_3`.

/*
For example, `CGAL::Regular_triangulation_3` inherits `CGAL::Triangulation_3`
with `Point` being a three-dimensional weighted point. Since some predicates and
constructors (such as `Orientation_3`) can only use `Point_3` objects in arguments,
it is necessary to convert objects of type `Point` to objects of type `Point_3`
before calling these functions, using the kernel functor `Construct_point_3`.
In the setting of a basic triangulation, `Point` and `Point_3` are identical and
so `Construct_point_3` is simply the identity. Refinements of this concept will
require more significant overloads to the `Construct_point_3` functor.
