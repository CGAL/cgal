\ingroup PkgTriangulation3Concepts
\cgalConcept

The concept `DelaunayTriangulationTraits_3` is the first template parameter of the class
`Delaunay_triangulation_3`. It defines the geometric objects (points,
segments...) forming the triangulation together with a few geometric
predicates and constructions on these objects.

\cgalRefines `TriangulationTraits_3`

\cgalHasModel `CGAL::Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel` (recommended)
\cgalHasModel `CGAL::Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel` (recommended for Voronoi)
\cgalHasModel `CGAL::Filtered_kernel`
\cgalHasModel `CGAL::Cartesian`
\cgalHasModel `CGAL::Simple_cartesian`
\cgalHasModel `CGAL::Homogeneous`
\cgalHasModel `CGAL::Simple_homogeneous`

In addition to the requirements described for the traits class of
`CGAL::Triangulation_3`, the geometric traits class of a
  Delaunay triangulation must fulfill the following requirements:
