\ingroup PkgTriangulation3TriangulationClasses

The class `Delaunay_triangulation_3` represents a three-dimensional
Delaunay triangulation.

\tparam Traits is the geometric traits class and must be a model of `DelaunayTriangulationTraits_3`.

\tparam TDS is the triangulation data structure and must be a model of `TriangulationDataStructure_3`.
`Default` may be used, with default type `Triangulation_data_structure_3<Triangulation_vertex_base_3<Traits>,
                                                                         Delaunay_triangulation_cell_base_3<Traits> >`.
Any custom type can be used instead of `Triangulation_vertex_base_3`
and `Delaunay_triangulation_cell_base_3`, provided that they are models of the
concepts `TriangulationVertexBase_3` and `DelaunayTriangulationCellBase_3`,
respectively.

\tparam LP is a tag which must be a `Location_policy<Tag>`:
either `CGAL::Fast_location` or `CGAL::Compact_location`.
`CGAL::Fast_location` offers faster (\f$ O(\log n)\f$ time) point
location, which can be beneficial when performing point locations or random
point insertions (with no good location hint) in large data sets.
It is currently implemented using an additional triangulation
hierarchy data structure \cgalCite{cgal:d-dh-02}.
The default is `CGAL::Compact_location`, which saves memory (3-5%) by avoiding the need for this
separate data structure, and point location is then performed roughly in
\f$ O(n^{1/3})\f$ time.
If the triangulation is parallel (see user manual), the default compact
location policy must be used.
Note that this argument can also come in second position, which can be useful when
the default value for the `TDS` parameter is
satisfactory (this is achieved using so-called deduced parameters).
Note that this argument replaces the functionality
provided before \cgal 3.6 by `Triangulation_hierarchy_3`.
An example of use can be found in the user
manual \ref Triangulation3exfastlocation.

\tparam SLDS is an optional parameter to specify the type of the spatial lock data structure.
        It must be a model of the `SurjectiveLockDataStructure` concept,
        with `Object` being a `Point` (as defined below).
        It is only used if the triangulation data structure used is concurrency-safe (i.e.\ when
        `TDS::Concurrency_tag` is `CGAL::Parallel_tag`).
        The default value is `Spatial_lock_grid_3<Tag_priority_blocking>` if
        the triangulation data structure is concurrency-safe, and `void` otherwise.
        In order to use concurrent operations, the user must provide a
        reference to a `SurjectiveLockDataStructure`
        instance via the constructor or `Triangulation_3::set_lock_data_structure()`.

If `TDS::Concurrency_tag` is `CGAL::Parallel_tag`, some operations,
such as insertion/removal of a range of points, are performed in parallel. See
the documentation of the operations for more details.

/*! \name Removal

When a vertex `v` is removed from a triangulation, all the cells
incident to `v` must be removed, and the polyhedral region consisting
of all the tetrahedra that are incident to `v` must be
re-triangulated. So, the problem reduces to triangulating a polyhedral
region, while preserving its boundary, or to compute a
*constrained* triangulation. This is known to be sometimes
impossible: the Sch&ouml;nhardt polyhedron cannot be triangulated
\cgalCite{cgal:s-cgehd-98}. However, when dealing with Delaunay
triangulations, the case of such polyhedra that cannot be
re-triangulated cannot happen, so \cgal proposes a vertex removal.

If,due to some point removals, the size of the Delaunay triangulation
decreases drastically, it might be interesting to defragment the
`CGAL::Compact_container` (used by the `Triangulation_data_structure_3`).
