\ingroup PkgTriangulation3VertexCellClasses

The class `Regular_triangulation_vertex_base_3` is a model of the concept
`RegularTriangulationVertexBase_3`, the base vertex of a 3D regular triangulation.
This class stores a weighted point.

This class can be used directly or can serve as a base to derive other classes
with some additional attributes (a color for example) tuned for a specific
application.


\tparam Traits is the geometric traits class and must be a model of `RegularTriangulationTraits_3`.
Users of the geometric triangulations are strongly advised to use the same
geometric traits class as the one used in `Regular_triangulation_3`.
This way, the point type defined by the base vertex is
the same as the point type defined by the geometric traits class.

\tparam TDSVb is a combinatorial vertex base class from which
`Regular_triangulation_vertex_base_3` derives.
It must be a model of the `TriangulationDSVertexBase_3` concept.
It has the default value `Triangulation_ds_vertex_base_3<TDS>`.
