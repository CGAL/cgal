\ingroup PkgTriangulation3VertexCellClasses

The class `Regular_triangulation_cell_base_with_weighted_circumcenter_3` derives from
`Cb`, a cell base class of a 3D triangulation.
It provides an easy way to cache the computation of the weighted circumcenters of
tetrahedra.
Note that input/output operators discard this additional information.

All functions modifying the vertices of the cell invalidate the cached
circumcenter.

\tparam Traits is the geometric traits class and must be a model of `RegularTriangulationTraits_3`.

\tparam Cb is a cell base class from which
`Regular_triangulation_cell_base_with_weighted_circumcenter_3` derives. Cb should
be a model of `RegularTriangulationCellBase_3`.
It has the default value `Regular_triangulation_cell_base_3<RT>`.

/*! \name Access function

As a model of the concept `RegularTriangulationCellBase_3`,
`Regular_triangulation_cell_base_with_weighted_circumcenter_3`
provides a `weighted_circumcenter()` member fonction.

In this model, the `weighted_circumcenter()` member fonction returns the <b>weighted circumcenter</b>
of the cell.
This `Point_3` is computed using the `Construct_weighted_circumcenter_3` functor
of the traits class when this function is first called and its value is stored.
In the next calls, the cached value is returned.

Note that the returned point has no weight.
