\ingroup PkgTriangulationOnSphere2TriangulationClasses

The class `Delaunay_triangulation_on_sphere_2` is designed to represent
the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points on the 2-sphere.

A Delaunay triangulation of a set of points is a triangulation of the set of points that fulfills
the following <I>empty circle property</I> (also called <I>Delaunay property</I>): the circumscribing
sphere of any simplex of the triangulation contains no point of the set in its interior.
For a point set with no case of co-circularity of more than three points,
the Delaunay triangulation is unique, and defined as the dual of the Voronoi diagram of the points.

The setting of 3D points on the 2-sphere is particular in that the empty circle property
can be reduced to a single 3D orientation test \cgalCite{cgal:ccplr-redtp-10}.

\tparam Traits is the geometric traits; it must be a model of `DelaunayTriangulationOnSphereTraits_2`.

\tparam TDS is the triangulation data structure, which must be a model of `TriangulationDataStructure_2`
        whose vertex base must be a model of `TriangulationOnSphereVertexBase_2` and whose face base
        must be a model of `TriangulationOnSphereFaceBase_2`. \cgal provides a default instantiation
        for this parameter, which is the class
        `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2 < CGAL::Triangulation_on_sphere_vertex_base_2<Traits>,
                                                CGAL::Triangulation_on_sphere_face_base_2<Traits> >`.

  the boundary of the zone in conflict with `p`. The boundary edges of the conflict zone
