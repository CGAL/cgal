\ingroup PkgTriangulationOnSphere2TriangulationClasses

The class `Delaunay_triangulation_on_sphere_traits_2` is a model
of the concept `DelaunayTriangulationOnSphereTraits_2`.

The `Point_on_sphere_2` type is implemented as a kernel `Point_3` type.

If the kernel template parameter `LK` does not enable exact representation of points on sphere
(i.e., at least a mean to represent algebraic coordinates), then it cannot be guaranteed
that all points on the sphere are in a convex position and thus some points might be hidden upon insertion.
It is possible to ensure that no point can be hidden by enforcing a tiny gap between points \cgalCite{cgal:ccplr-redtp-10}.
In Lemma 4.1 of this publication, it is in particular proven that if points lie within a distance
\f$ \delta \f$ of the sphere, no point is hidden as long as points are separated by at least \f$ 2 \sqrt{R\delta} \f$
with \f$ R \f$ the radius of the sphere.

Thus, if `LK` offers exact representation, then \f$ \delta \f$ is set to \f$ 0 \f$.
Otherwise, \f$ \delta \f$ is set to the maximal distance between two consecutive `LK::FT`
for the coordinates of a point that is (theoretically) on the sphere.
This bound \f$ \delta \f$ is then used in the functions `is_on_sphere()` and `are_points_too_close()`
using the relation above to ensure that a point being inserted is either marked as "too close"
(see \link CGAL::Triangulation_on_sphere_2::Locate_type `CGAL::Triangulation_on_sphere_2<Traits,TDS>::Locate_type` \endlink)
and thus not inserted, or guaranteed to not be hidden upon insertion.

\tparam LK a linear kernel type; it must be a model of `Kernel`.
\tparam SK a spherical kernel type; it must be a model of `SphericalKernel` refining `LK`.
