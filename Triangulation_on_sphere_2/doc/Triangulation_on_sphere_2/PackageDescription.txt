A triangulation is a 2-dimensional simplicial complex that is pure,
connected, and without singularities. It can be viewed as a collection of triangular faces,
such that two faces either have an empty intersection or share an edge or a vertex.

This package handles triangulations of points on the 2-sphere, and is thus tightly linked
to the package \ref PkgTriangulation2, which handles triangulations of points in Euclidean 2D space,
since both domains are 2-manifolds. Concepts and classes are therefore similar
to those of the package \ref PkgTriangulation2.

The basic elements of the representation are vertices and faces.
Each triangular face gives access to its three incident vertices
and to its three adjacent faces.
Each vertex gives access to one of its incident faces
and, through that face, to the circular list of its incident faces.
The edges are not explicitly represented, they are only represented
through the adjacency relations of two faces.

The triangulation classes of \cgal depend on two template parameters.
The first template parameter stands for a geometric traits class which is assumed to provide
the geometric objects (points, segments, ...) forming the triangulation
and the geometric predicates on those objects.
The second template parameter stands for a model of triangulation data structure
acting as a container for faces and vertices while taking care
of the combinatorial aspects of the triangulation.
The concepts and models relative to the triangulation data structure
are described in Chapter \ref PkgTDS2Ref "2D Triangulation Data Structure".
