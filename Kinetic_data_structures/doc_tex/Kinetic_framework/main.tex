This chapter describes a framework for implementing kinetic data
structures and sweepline algorithms. If you just would like to use
existing kinetic data structures, please read
Chapter~\ref{chapter-kds} instead. Readers wishing to brush up on
their familiarity with kinetic data structures or better understand
the terminology we use should read Section~\ref{sec:kds_intro} of that
chapter.  A brief overview of the framework can be found in
Section~\ref{sec:kds_overview} (also of that chapter) and it too is
recommended reading. Here we dive right in to discussing to discussing
the architecture of the framework in
Section~\ref{sec:kds_architecture} and finally we give several
examples of using the framework to implement a kinetic data structure
in Section~\ref{sec:kds_examples}. The framework makes heavy use of
our \ccc{Polynomial_kernel} package to provide models of the
\ccc{Kinetic::FunctionKernel} concept.

The framework was first presented at ALENEX~\cite{cgal:gkr-cfhm-04}.
