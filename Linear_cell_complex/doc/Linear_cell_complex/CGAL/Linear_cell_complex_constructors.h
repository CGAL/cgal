\ingroup PkgLinearCellComplexConstructions

Imports an embedded plane graph read from `ais` into `lcc`, a model of the `LinearCellComplex` concept. Objects are added in `lcc`, existing darts are not modified. Returns a dart created during the import.

\cgalHeading{File format}

The file format must be the following. First the number of vertices and the number of edges of the planar graph. Then, for each vertex of the planar graph, the coordinates of the \f$ i^{\mbox{th}}\f$ vertex (two numbers for \f$ x\f$ and \f$ y\f$ coordinates). The first vertex index is 0. Then for each edge of the planar graph, the two indices of the two vertices (two numbers between 0 and the number of vertices minus 1).

Here a small example:
\verbatim
5 6
1.0 3.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.0
0 1 0 2 1 2 1 3 2 4 3 4
\endverbatim
