/* The different recursive filter's types.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * - ALPHA_DERICHE is the first recurvise filter designed
 *   by R. Deriche. See REFERENCES.
 *
 * - with ALPHA_DERICHE's filters, one can either compute
 *   derivatives from order 0 (smoothing) to 3, or extract edges.
 *
 * - GAUSSIAN_DERICHE is a 4th order recursive filter which
 *   approximates the gaussien. See
 *   "Recursively Implementing The Gaussian and Its Derivatives",
 *   R. Deriche, International Conference On Image Processing,
 *   pp 263-267, Singapore, September 1992. Also INRIA research
 *   report.
 *
 * - with GAUSSIAN_DERICHE's filters, one can either compute
 *   derivatives from order 0 (smoothing) to 2, or extract edges.
 *
 * - Extracting edges with ALPHA_DERICHE's filters is faster but
 *   the modulus of the gradient (the estimated height of the step
 *   edge) depens on the gradient orientation because the filter
 *   is not isotropic. Heights are better estimated with
 *   GAUSSIAN_DERICHE's filters but they seem not be perfectly
 *   symmetrical.

/* Order of the derivative to be computed.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * - NODERIVATIVE nothing will be done.
 *
 * - DERIVATIVE_0 means smoothing.
 *
 * - DERIVATIVE_1 first derivative. The normalization
 *   of the filter is made so that the response to the
 *   signal i=x will be 1.
 *
 * - DERIVATIVE_1_CONTOURS first derivative but adapted
 *   to edge detections. The normalization of the filter
 *   is made so that the response to a step edge is
 *   the step edge height.
 *
 * - DERIVATIVE_2 second derivative. The normalization
 *   of the filter is made so that the response to the
 *   signal i=x*2/2 will be 1.
 *
 * - DERIVATIVE_3 third derivative. The normalization
 *   of the filter is made so that the response to the
 *   signal i=x*3/6 will be 1.
