/* Recursive filtering on 3D buffers.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * Performs recursive filtering on 3D buffers.
 * Each direction (X, Y or Z) is performed
 * independently (separability).
 *
 * A direction is filtered if there are enough
 * points along this direction (at least 5),
 * if the coefficient along this direction is
 * positive, and if the derivative's order along
 * this direction is not NODERIVATIVE (see
 * derivativeOrder).
 *
 * Once a line along a direction is extracted for
 * filtering, one may want to add points at both
 * ends of the line to avoid cut-off effects. The
 * value of each endpoint is repeated n times.
 * Thus the length of the line is increased by
 * 2*n.
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *
 * - bufferDims[0] is the dimension along X,
 *
 *   bufferDims[1] is the dimension along Y,
 *
 *   bufferDims[2] is the dimension along Y.
 *
 * - borderLengths[0] is the number of points to be
 *   added at both ends of each X line (if
 *   positive). The value of each endpoint is
 *   repeated borderLengths[0] times to produce
 *   a line of length
 *   bufferDims[0] + 2 * borderLengths[0].
 *
 *   borderLengths[1] is the number of points to be
 *   added at both ends of each Y line.
 *
 *   borderLengths[2] is the number of points to be
 *   added at both ends of each Z line.
 *
 * - derivatives[0] is the order of the derivative
 *   to be computed along direction X.
 *
 *   derivatives[1] is the order of the derivative
 *   to be computed along direction Y.
 *
 *   derivatives[2] is the order of the derivative
 *   to be computed along direction Z.
 *
 * - filterCoefs[0] is the coefficient of the filter
 *   to be applied along direction X.
 *
 *   filterCoefs[1] is the coefficient of the filter
 *   to be applied along direction Y.
 *
 *   filterCoefs[2] is the coefficient of the filter
 *   to be applied along direction Z.
 *
 * - filterType is the type of recursive filter to
 *   be applied to the 3D buffer.
 *
 * RETURN:
 *
 * - 0 in case of error
 *
 * - 1 if successful
 *
 * SEE ALSO:
 *
 * - bufferType.
 *
 * - derivativeOrder.
 *
 * - recursiveFilterType.
 *
 * - InitRecursiveCoefficients
