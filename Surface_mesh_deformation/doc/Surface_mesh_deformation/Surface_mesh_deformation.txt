\section SMD_Intro Introduction
This package offers surface mesh deformation algorithms which compute new vertex positions of a surface mesh
under positional constraints of some of its vertices, without requiring any additional structure other than the surface mesh itself

This package implements the algorithm described in \cgalCite{Sorkine2007AsRigidAs} together with an
alternative energy function \cgalCite{Chao2010SimpleGeomModel}.
The algorithm minimizes a nonlinear deformation energy under positional constraints to preserve rigidity as much as possible.
The minimization of the energy relies on solving sparse linear systems and finding closest rotation matrices.

\section SMD_Def Definitions

A <em>surface mesh deformation system</em> consists of:
- a triangulated surface mesh (<em>surface mesh</em> in the following),
- a set of vertices defining the region to deform (referred to as the <em>region-of-interest</em> and abbreviated <em>ROI</em>),
- a subset of vertices from the ROI that the user wants to move (referred to as the <em>control vertices</em>),
- a target position for each control vertex (defining the <em>deformation constraints</em>).

A vertex from the ROI that is not a control vertex is called an <em>unconstrained vertex</em>. These definitions are depicted in \cgalFigureRef{Simple_roi}.

\cgalFigureBegin{Simple_roi, roi_example.png}
The ROI features the green vertices (the unconstrained vertices) and the red vertices (the control vertices).

\cgalFigureEnd

In this package, three algorithms are implemented:
- The <em>As-Rigid-As-Possible</em> (<em>ARAP</em>) method \cgalCite{Sorkine2007AsRigidAs};
- The <em>Spokes and Rims</em> method \cgalCite{Chao2010SimpleGeomModel};
- The <em>Smoothed %Rotation Enhanced As-Rigid-As-Possible</em> method \cgalCite{levismooth}

Given an edge weighting scheme, both methods iteratively minimize an energy function and produce a different surface mesh at each step until convergence is reached.

<em>Spokes and Rims</em> is the default method proposed by the package. It provides an unconditional
convergence while the <em>ARAP</em> method requires the edge weights to be positive. However,
the results obtained using the <em>Spokes and Rims</em> method are more dependent on the discretization
of the deformed surface (See \cgalFigureRef{Arap_spokes_comparison}).

The <em>Smoothed %Rotation Enhanced As-Rigid-As-Possible</em> method adds a bending term to the ARAP energy that penalizes rotation difference between neighboring elements. In the current implementation a 1-ring type element is used while in general it is possible to use a triangle type element.

More details on these algorithms are provided in section \ref SMD_Overview.

\section SMD_API User Interface Description

The deformation methods implemented rely on solving a sparse linear system.
The sparse matrix definition depends on the weighting scheme
and on the unconstrained and control vertices.
The right term depends only on the target positions of the control vertices.

The deformation process is handled by the class `Surface_mesh_deformation` and the
surface mesh is represented as a halfedge data structure that must
be a model of the `HalfedgeGraph` concept.

The class `Surface_mesh_deformation` provides two groups of functions for
the preprocessing (sparse matrix definition) and the deformation (right hand term definition).

\subsection Preprocess_section Preprocessing

The preprocessing consists in computing a factorization of the aforementioned sparse
matrix to speed up the linear system resolution.
It requires the ROI to be defined.
The following conventions are used for the definition of the ROI:
 - A vertex inserted in the set of control vertices is inserted in the ROI;
 - A control vertex erased from the ROI is no longer considered as a control vertex;
 - A control vertex that is erased is not erased from the ROI.

Each time the ROI is modified, the preprocessing function `preprocess()`
must be called.
Note that if it is not done, the first deformation step calls this function automatically
and has a longer runtime compared to subsequent deformation steps.

<!--- This is a pure implementation details as it does not shows up in the ROI
This function also extends the ROI by adding as <em>fixed control vertex</em> any vertex not in the ROI that is adjacent
to a vertex of the ROI. The target position of a fixed control vertex is its current position and cannot be changed.
-->

The function `Surface_mesh_deformation::preprocess()` returns `true` if the factorization is successful, and `false` otherwise.

Rank deficiency is the main reason for failure. Typical failure cases are:
  - All the vertices are in the ROI and no control vertices are set
  - The weighting scheme used to fill the sparse matrix (model of `SurfaceMeshDeformationWeights`) features too many zeros and breaks the connectivity information

\cgalAdvancedBegin
The choice of the weighting scheme provides a mean to adjust the way the control vertices
influences the unconstrained vertices. The defaults provides satisfactory results in general
but other weighting schemes may be selected or designed to experiment or improve the results
in specific cases.
\cgalAdvancedEnd

\note The ROI does not have to be a connected component of the graph of the surface mesh. However, for better performances
it is better to use an individual instance of the deformation object for each connected component.

\subsection Deform_section Deformation

The deformation of the surface mesh is triggered by the displacement of the control vertices.
This is achieved through setting the target positions of the control vertices (directly or by using an affine transformation
to be applied to a control vertex or a range of control vertices).

Note that a rotation or a translation of a control vertex is always applied on its last target position set:
they are cumulative.

The deformation of the surface mesh happens when calling the function `Surface_mesh_deformation::deform()`. The number of optimization iterations
varies depending on whether the user chooses a fixed number of iterations or a stopping criterion based on the energy variation.

After the call to the deformation function, the input surface mesh is updated and the control vertices are at
their target positions and the unconstrained vertices are moved accordingly.
The function `Surface_mesh_deformation::deform()` can be called several times consecutively, in particular
if the convergence has not been reached yet (otherwise it has no effect).

\warning Vertices can be inserted into or erased from the ROI and the set of control vertices at any time.
In particular, any vertex that is no longer inside the ROI will be assigned to its original position when
`Surface_mesh_deformation::preprocess()` is first called.
The original positions can be updated by calling `Surface_mesh_deformation::overwrite_initial_geometry()` (
which will also require a new preprocessing step).
This behavior is illustrated in \ref SModelingVideo_1 "Video 1".

\subsection Surface_mesh_deformation_arap_or_spokes_and_rims As-Rigid-As-Possible and Spokes-and-Rims Deformation Techniques
Three deformation techniques are provided by this package. This section summarizes from the user point of view what is
explained in details in the section \ref SMD_Overview.

The As-Rigid-As-Possible deformation techniques require the use of a positive weighting scheme to guarantee
the correct minimization of the energy. When using the default cotangent weighting scheme, this means that
the input surface mesh must be <em>clean</em>. That is, that for all edges in the surface mesh
the sum of the angles opposite to the edge in the incident triangles is less that \f$ \pi \f$.
If this is not the case and the targeted application allows the modification of the surface mesh connectivity,
a solution (amongst other) is to bissect (possibly recursively) the problematic edges.
See \cgalFigureRef{Cotangent_bisect_fig}.

\cgalFigureBegin{Cotangent_bisect_fig, cotangent_bisect.png}
Cotangent weight of edges. (Left) The sum of the opposite angles to the edge \f$ e \f$, \f$ \alpha + \beta \f$
is greater than \f$ \pi \f$. The cotangent weight of \f$ e \f$ is negative.
(Right) The edge \f$ e \f$ was split so that the sum of the angles opposite
to each sub-edge \f$ e_1 \f$ and \f$ e_2 \f$ is less than \f$ \pi \f$. The corresponding
cotangent weights are positive.
\cgalFigureEnd

If the mesh connectivity must be preserved, the Spokes and Rims deformation technique
is guaranteed to always correctly minimize the energy even if the weights are negative.
However, this technique is more dependent on the discretization of the deformed surface
(See \cgalFigureRef{Arap_spokes_comparison}).

\subsection Surface_mesh_deformation_examples Examples

\subsubsection SModelingExample_1 Using the Whole Surface Mesh as Region-of-Interest
In this example, the whole surface mesh is used as ROI and a few vertices are added as control vertices.
`Surface_mesh_deformation::set_target_position()` is used for setting the target positions of the control vertices.

\cgalFigureEnd

\subsubsection SModelingExample_2 Using an Affine Transformation on a Range of Vertices
In this example, we use the functions `translate()` and `rotate()` on a range of control vertices.
Note that the translations and the rotations are defined using a 3D vector type and a quaternion type from the \ref thirdpartyEigen "Eigen library".

\cgalFigureEnd

\subsubsection SModelingExample_3 Using Polyhedron without Ids
In the previous examples, we used an <i>enriched</i> polyhedron storing an ID
in its halfedges and vertices together with the default property maps
in the deformation object to access them.
In the following example, we show how we can use alternative property maps.

For practical performance however we recommend relying upon
the former examples instead, as using a `std::map`
to access indices increases the complexity from constant to logarithmic.
\cgalExample{Surface_mesh_deformation/deform_polyhedron_with_custom_pmap_example.cpp}

\subsubsection SModelingExample_4 Using a Custom Edge Weighting Scheme
Using a custom weighting scheme for edges is also possible if one provides a model of `SurfaceMeshDeformationWeights`.
In this example, the weight of each edge is pre-computed and an internal map is used for storing and accessing them.


Another example is given in the manual page of the concept `::SurfaceMeshDeformationWeights`.

\cgalExample{Surface_mesh_deformation/custom_weight_for_edges_example.cpp}

\subsubsection SModelingExample_5 Using the Smoothed Rotation Enhanced As-Rigid-As-Possible
In this example, a survey \cgalCite{Botsch2008OnLinearVariational} model is loaded, alpha that determines the influence of the bending term is set, and the deformation method is set to `SRE_ARAP`.

\cgalExample{Surface_mesh_deformation/deform_mesh_for_botsch08_format_sre_arap.cpp}

\section SMD_Demo How to Use the Demo

A plugin for the polyhedron demo is available to test the algorithm. The following video tutorials explain how to use it.
When the deformation dock window is open, the picking of control vertices and of the ROI is done by pressing <i>Shift</i>
and clicking with the left button of the mouse.
The displacement of the vertices is triggered when the <i>Ctrl</i> button is pressed.

\section SMD_Overview Deformation Techniques, Energies and Weighting Schemes
This section gives the theoretical background to make the user manual self-contained
and at the same time explains where the weights comes in. This allows advanced users
of this package to tune the weighting scheme by developing a model of the concept
`SurfaceMeshDeformationWeights` used in the class `Surface_mesh_deformation`.

\subsection SMD_Overview_Preliminaries Preliminaries
\subsubsection SMD_Overview_Laplacian Laplacian Representation
The <em>Laplacian representation</em> (referred to as <em>Laplace coordinates</em> in \cgalCite{botsch2010polygon})
of a vertex in a surface mesh is one way to <em>encode</em> the local neighborhood of a vertex in the surface mesh.
In this representation, a vertex \f$ \mathbf{v}_i \f$ is associated a 3D vector defined as:

\f[
\begin{equation}
L(\mathbf{v}_i) = \sum_{\mathbf{v}_j \in N(\mathbf{v}_i)} w_{ij}(\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_j),
  \label{eq:lap_open}
\end{equation}
\f]

where:
- \f$N(\mathbf{v}_i)\f$ denotes the set of vertices adjacent to \f$\mathbf{v}_i\f$;
-\f$w_{ij}\f$ denotes a weight for the directed edge \f$\mathbf{v}_i\ \mathbf{v}_j\f$.

The simplest choice for the weights is the uniform scheme where \f$ w_{ij}=1/|N(\mathbf{v}_i)| \f$ for each adjacent vertex
\f$\mathbf{v}_j\f$. In this case, the Laplacian representation of a vertex is the vector between this vertex
and the centroid of its adjacent vertices (\cgalFigureRef{Simple_laplacian}).

In the surface mesh deformation context, a popular choice is the cotangent weight scheme
that derives from the discretization of the Laplace operator \cgalCite{Pinkall1993Cotangent} :
Given an edge of the surface mesh, its corresponding cotangent weight is the mean of the
cotangents of the angles opposite to the edge. It was shown to produce results that are not biased by the surface mesh of the approximated surface
\cgalCite{Sorkine2007AsRigidAs}.

\cgalFigureBegin{Simple_laplacian,simple_mesh_with_laplacian.png}
Laplacian representation of \f$ v_i \f$ with uniform weights: the red square vertex is the centroid of the vertices adjacent to \f$ v_i \f$. The Laplacian representation \f$ L(v_i) \f$ is represented as a blue vector.
\cgalFigureEnd

Considering a surface mesh with \f$n\f$ vertices, it is possible to define its <i>Laplacian representation</i> \f$\Delta\f$ as a \f$n \times 3\f$ matrix:

\f[
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{L}\mathbf{V} = \Delta,
  \label{eq:lap_system}
\end{equation}
\f]

where:
- \f$\mathbf{L}\f$ is a \f$n \times n\f$ sparse matrix, referred to as the <em>Laplacian matrix</em>. Its elements \f$ m_{ij} \f$, \f$i,j \in \{1 \dots n\} \f$ are defined as follows:
  - \f$ m_{ii} \f$ = \f$ \sum_{\mathbf{v}_j \in N(\mathbf{v}_i)}w_{ij} \f$,
  - \f$ m_{ij} = -w_{ij} \f$ if \f$ \mathbf{v}_j \in N(\mathbf{v_i}) \f$,
  - \f$ 0 \f$ otherwise.
- \f$\mathbf{V}\f$ is a \f$n \times 3\f$ matrix made of the %Cartesian coordinates of the vertices.


\subsubsection SMD_Overview_Laplacian_Deformation Laplacian Deformation

This section is an introduction to provide the background for the next two sub-sections describing the algorithms implemented
in this package. A system relying only on the approach described below results in non-smooth transitions in the neighborhood of
the control vertices. For a survey on different Laplacian-based editing techniques we refer to
\cgalCite{Botsch2008OnLinearVariational}.

The main idea behind Laplacian-based deformation techniques is to preserve the Laplacian representation
under deformation constraints. The Laplacian representation of a surface mesh is treated as a representative form of the discretized surface,
and the deformation process must follow the deformation constraints while preserving the Laplacian representation as much as possible.

There are different ways to incorporate deformation constraints into the deformation system \cgalCite{Botsch2008OnLinearVariational}.
This package supports hard constraints, that is, target positions of control vertices are preserved after the deformation.

Given a surface mesh deformation system with a ROI made of \f$ n \f$ vertices and \f$ k \f$ control vertices, we consider the following linear system:

\f[
\begin{equation}
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\mathbf{L}_f\\
0 \; \mathbf{I}_c
\end{array}
\right]
\mathbf{V} =
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
{\Delta}_f \\
\mathbf{V}_c
\end{array}
\right],
\label{eq:lap_energy_system}
\end{equation}
\f]

where:
- \f$\mathbf{V}\f$ is a \f$n \times 3\f$ matrix denoting the unknowns of the system that represent the vertex coordinates after deformation. The system is built so that the \f$ k \f$ last rows correspond to the control vertices.
- \f$\mathbf{L}_f\f$ denotes the Laplacian matrix of the unconstrained vertices. It is a \f$ (n-k) \times n \f$ matrix as defined in Eq. \f$\eqref{eq:lap_system}\f$ but removing the rows corresponding to the control vertices.
- \f$\mathbf{I}_c\f$ is the \f$k \times k\f$ identity matrix.
- \f${\Delta}_f\f$ denotes the Laplacian representation of the unconstrained vertices as defined in Eq. \f$\eqref{eq:lap_system}\f$ but removing the rows corresponding to the control vertices.
- \f$\mathbf{V}_c\f$ is a \f$k \times 3\f$ matrix containing the %Cartesian coordinates of the target positions of the control vertices.

The left-hand side matrix of the system of Eq.\f$\eqref{eq:lap_energy_system}\f$ is a square non-symmetric sparse matrix. To
solve the aforementioned system, an appropriate solver (e.g. LU solver) needs to be used. Note that solving this system
preserves the Laplacian representation of the surface mesh restricted to the unconstrained vertices while satisfying the deformation constraints.

\subsection SMD_Overview_ARAP As-Rigid-As Possible Deformation

Given a surface mesh \f$M\f$ with \f$ n \f$ vertices \f$ \{\mathbf{v}_i\} i \in \{1 \dots n  \} \f$ and some deformation
constraints, we consider the following energy function:

\f[
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\mathbf{v}_i \in M}
\sum_{\mathbf{v}_j \in N(\mathbf{v}_i)} w_{ij}
\left\| (\mathbf{v}'_i - \mathbf{v}'_j) - \mathbf{R}_i(\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_j) \right\|^2,
  \label{eq:arap_energy}
\end{equation}
\f]

where:
- \f$\mathbf{R}_i\f$ is a \f$ 3 \times 3 \f$ rotation matrix
- \f$w_{ij}\f$ denotes a weight
- \f$N(\mathbf{v}_i)\f$ denotes the set of vertices adjacent to \f$\mathbf{v}_i\f$ in \f$M\f$
- \f$N(\mathbf{v}'_i)\f$ denotes a new position of the vertex \f$N(\mathbf{v}_i)\f$ after a given deformation

An as-rigid-as possible surface mesh deformation \cgalCite{Sorkine2007AsRigidAs} is defined by minimizing
this energy function under the deformation constraints, i.e. the assigned position
\f$ {v}'_i\f$ for each vertex \f$ \mathbf{v}_i\f$ in the set of control vertices.
Defining the <i>one-ring neighborhood</i> of a vertex as its set of adjacent vertices,
the intuitive idea behind this energy function is to allow each one-ring neighborhood of
vertices to have an individual rotation, and at the same time to prevent shearing by taking advantage of the
overlapping of one-ring neighborhoods of adjacent vertices (see \cgalFigureRef{Overlapping_cells}).


\cgalFigureBegin{Overlapping_cells,overlapping_cells.png}
Overlaps of one-ring neighborhoods of vertices.
The one-ring neighborhoods of four vertices
are drawn with different colors, the corresponding vertex is colored accordingly.
\cgalFigureEnd

There are two unknowns per vertex in Eq. \f$\eqref{eq:arap_energy}\f$: the new positions (\f$\mathbf{v}'_k\f$) of the unconstrained
vertices and the rotation matrices (\f$\mathbf{R}_i\f$).
If the energy contribution of each vertex is positive, this boils down to minimizing the energy contribution of each vertex \f$\mathbf{v}_i\f$.

Each such term of the energy is minimized by using a two-step optimization approach (also called local-global approach).

In the first step, the positions of the vertices are considered as fixed so that the rotation matrices are the only unknowns.

For the vertex \f$\mathbf{v}_i\f$, we consider the covariance matrix \f$\mathbf{S}_i\f$:
\f[
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S}_i = \sum_{\mathbf{v}_j \in N(\mathbf{v}_i)} w_{ij} (\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_j)(\mathbf{v}'_i - \mathbf{v}'_j)^T,
\label{eq:cov_matrix}
\end{equation}
\f]

It was shown \cgalCite{Sorkine2009LeastSquaresRigid} that minimizing the energy contribution of
\f$\mathbf{v}_i\f$ in Eq. \f$\eqref{eq:arap_energy}\f$ is equivalent to maximizing the trace of the matrix
\f$\mathbf{R}_i \mathbf{S}_i\f$. \f$\mathbf{R}_i \f$ is the transpose of the unitary matrix in the polar decomposition
of \f$\mathbf{S}_i\f$.


In the second step, the rotation matrices are substituted into the partial derivative of Eq.\f$\eqref{eq:arap_energy}\f$
with respect to \f$\mathbf{v}'_i\f$. Assuming the weights are symmetric, setting the derivative to zero results in the
following equation:

\f[
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\mathbf{v}_j \in N(\mathbf{v}_i)} w_{ij}(\mathbf{v}'_i - \mathbf{v}'_j) =
\sum_{\mathbf{v}_j \in N(\mathbf{v}_i)} w_{ij} \frac{(\mathbf{R}_i + \mathbf{R}_j)}{2} (\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_j).
\label{eq:lap_ber}
\end{equation}
\f]

The left-hand side of this equation corresponds to the one of Eq.\f$\eqref{eq:lap_open}\f$,
and we can set \f$\Delta\f$ to be the right-hand side.
Solving the linear system in Eq. \f$\eqref{eq:lap_energy_system}\f$ gives the new positions of the unconstrained vertices.

This two-step optimization can be applied several times iteratively to obtain a better result.

\note The matrix built with the Laplacian matrix of the unconstrained vertices in the left-hand side of
Eq. \f$\eqref{eq:lap_energy_system}\f$ depends only on the initial surface mesh structure and on which vertices
are control vertices. Once the control vertices are set, we can use a direct solver to factorize
the sparse matrix in Eq. \f$\eqref{eq:lap_energy_system}\f$, and reuse this factorization during
each iteration of the optimization procedure.

The original algorithm \cgalCite{Sorkine2007AsRigidAs} we described assumes that:

- the weight between two vertices is symmetric. In order to support asymmetric weights in our implementation,
we slightly change Eq. \f$\eqref{eq:lap_ber}\f$ to:
\f[
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\mathbf{v}_j \in N(\mathbf{v}_i)} (w_{ij} + w_{ji})(\mathbf{v}'_i - \mathbf{v}'_j) =
\sum_{\mathbf{v}_j \in N(\mathbf{v}_i)} (w_{ij}\mathbf{R}_i + w_{ji}\mathbf{R}_j)(\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_j).
\label{eq:lap_ber_asym}
\end{equation}
\f]

- The energy contribution of each vertex is positive. If the weight between two vertices is always positive, this is always the case.
 However, when using the cotangent weighting scheme (the default in our implementation), if the sum of the angles opposite to an edge is greater than \f$ \pi \f$,
its cotangent weight is negative. As a workaround for bad quality meshes, we eliminate those negative weights
by setting them to zero.

A method minimizing another energy function is described next to avoid the latter issue.

\subsection SMD_Overview_ARAP_Rims Spokes and Rims Version

The elastic energy function proposed by \cgalCite{Chao2010SimpleGeomModel} additionally takes into account
all the opposite edges in the facets incident to a vertex. The energy function to minimize becomes:

\f[
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\mathbf{v}_i \in M}
\sum_{(\mathbf{v}_j, \mathbf{v}_k) \in E(\mathbf{v}_i)} w_{jk}
\left\| (\mathbf{v}'_j - \mathbf{v}'_k) - \mathbf{R}_i(\mathbf{v}_j - \mathbf{v}_k) \right\|^2,
  \label{eq:arap_energy_rims}
\end{equation}
\f]

where \f$E(\mathbf{v}_i)\f$ consists of the set of edges incident to \f$\mathbf{v}_i\f$ (the <em>spokes</em>) and
the set of edges in the link (the <em>rims</em>) of \f$\mathbf{v}_i\f$ in the surface mesh \f$M\f$
(see \cgalFigureRef{Spoke_and_rim_edges}).

\cgalFigureBegin{Spoke_and_rim_edges, spoke_and_rim_edges_2.png}
The vertices \f$ \mathbf{v}_n\f$ and \f$ \mathbf{v}_m\f$ are the opposite vertices to the edge
\f$ \mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_j\f$.
\cgalFigureEnd

The method to get the new positions of the unconstrained vertices is similar to the two-step optimization
method explained in \ref SMD_Overview_ARAP.
For the first step, the Eq. \f$\eqref{eq:cov_matrix}\f$ is modified to take into account the edges in \f$E(\mathbf{v}_i)\f$:

\f[
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S}_i = \sum_{(\mathbf{v}_j, \mathbf{v}_k) \in E(\mathbf{v}_i)} w_{jk} (\mathbf{v}_j - \mathbf{v}_k)(\mathbf{v}'_j - \mathbf{v}'_k)^T,
\label{eq:cov_matrix_sr}
\end{equation}
\f]

For the second step, setting partial derivative of Eq. \f$\eqref{eq:arap_energy_rims}\f$ to zero with
respect to \f$\mathbf{v}_i\f$ gives the following equation:

\f[
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\mathbf{v}_j \in N(\mathbf{v}_i)} (w_{ij} + w_{ji})(\mathbf{v}'_i - \mathbf{v}'_j) =
\sum_{\mathbf{v}_j \in N(\mathbf{v}_i)} \frac{w_{ij}(\mathbf{R}_i + \mathbf{R}_j + \mathbf{R}_m) + w_{ji}(\mathbf{R}_i + \mathbf{R}_j + \mathbf{R}_n)}{3} (\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_j).
\label{eq:lap_ber_rims}
\end{equation}
\f]

where \f$\mathbf{R}_m\f$ and \f$\mathbf{R}_n\f$ are the rotation matrices of the vertices \f$\mathbf{v}_m\f$,
\f$\mathbf{v}_n\f$ which are the opposite vertices of the edge \f$\mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_j\f$
(see \cgalFigureRef{Spoke_and_rim_edges}). Note that if the edge \f$ \mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_j \f$ is on
the boundary of the surface mesh, then \f$ w_{ij} \f$ must be 0 and \f$ \mathbf{v}_m
\f$ does not exist.

An important property of this approach compared to \ref SMD_Overview_ARAP is that the contribution to the global energy
of each vertex is guaranteed to be non-negative when using the cotangent weights \cgalCite{Chao2010SimpleGeomModel}.
Thus even with negative weights, the minimization of the energy with the iterative method presented is always guaranteed.
However, this method is more dependent on the discretization of the deformed surface (See \cgalFigureRef{Arap_spokes_comparison}).

The implementation in this package uses the cotangent weights by default (negative values included) as proposed in \cgalCite{Chao2010SimpleGeomModel}.

\begin{equation}
\sum_{\mathbf{v}_i \in M}
\sum_{\mathbf{v}_j \in N(\mathbf{v}_i)} w_{ij}
\left\| (\mathbf{v}'_i - \mathbf{v}'_j) - \mathbf{R}_i(\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_j) \right\|^2 + \alpha A \left\| \mathbf{R}_i - \mathbf{R}_j \right\|^2_F
  \label{eq:sre_arap_energy}
\end{equation}
\f]

where 
- \f$\alpha=0.02\f$ is a weighting coefficient.
- \f$A\f$ is the surface area for scaling invariance. 

Only the local step is influenced by the added term, and the optimal rotation now takes into account the rotation of neighbors.

\section SMD_History Design and Implementation History
An initial version of this package has been implemented during the 2011 Google Summer of Code by Yin Xu under the guidance of Olga Sorkine and Andreas Fabri.
Ilker O. Yaz took over the finalization of the package with the help of Sébastien Loriot for the documentation and the API.
In 2016, Zohar Levi and Sébastien Loriot extended the package to support Smoothed Rotation Enhanced ARAP.
The authors are grateful to Gaël Guennebaud for his great help on using the Eigen library and for providing the code to compute
the closest rotation.
