\section Conforming Delaunay Triangulations in 3D

This package implements the construction of a 3D conforming Delaunay triangulation,
constrained to a set of faces of a surface polygon mesh.

For any Piecewise Linear Complex (PLC) in 3D,
the algorithm builds a Delaunay triangulation conforming to this PLC.
The constrained triangulation does not always exist, and it may be necessary
to add Steiner points to the PLC to make it triangulable.

The problem is described by Cohen-Steiner et al~\cgalCite{cgal:cohen2002conforming},
and by Si~\cgalCite{cgal:si2008cdt3}.


 * \todo Explain what is a CDT. Why a given input, like a polyhedron, might not admit a constrained Delaunay triangulation.
 * Explain "conforming to the faces of a polygon mesh".

\section CT_3_definitions Definitions

In this section, we define the main concepts that have to be understood to use this package.

\subsection CT_3_PLC Piecewise Linear Complex

A `Piecewise Linear Complex` is the 3-dimensional generalization of a polyhedron.

A PLC is built from simple geometric elements, called `simplices`
that are topologically connected together in a structured way.
`Simplices` (vertices, edges, and facets) are the basic elements forming the complex.
Their geometric counterparts are points, segments, polyhedra, respectively.
Each simplex is embedded into the geometric space via the points coordinates.

The simplices must satisfy the following conditions :
- they must be connected together by their common faces;
- each simplex is polygonal, with at least three vertices, that must be closed and coplanar;
- two edges can only intersect at a common vertex which is also in the PLC;
- two facets can only intersect at a common edge or vertex which is also in the PLC;
- two cells can only intersect at a common facet, edge or vertex which is also in the PLC.

\subsection CT_3_CDT Conforming Delaunay Triangulation

The goal of the algorithms developed in this package is to compute a Delaunay
mesh containing a given set of polygonal constraints in 3D as sub-complex.
See package \ref PkgTriangulation3 for more details on Delaunay triangulations.

In 3D, constrained triangulations do not always exist. It can be shown using the
example of the Schönhardt polyhedra, that requires the addition of Steiner points
to be triangulable.

The algorithm implemented in this package is based on the work of
/todo add references.
