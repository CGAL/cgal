\section CT_3_CCDT_3 Conforming Delaunay Triangulations in 3D

This package implements the construction of a 3D Constrained Delaunay triangulation,
conforming to a set of faces of a Piecewise Linear Complex.
The set of input polygonal constraints given as a PLC is meant to be represented as a
sub-complex of the triangulation.

For any Piecewise Linear Complex (PLC) in 3D,
the algorithm builds a Constrained Delaunay triangulation conforming to this PLC.
The constrained triangulation does not always exist, and it may be necessary
to add Steiner points to the PLC to make it tetrahedralizable.

The problem is described by Cohen-Steiner et al \cgalCite{cgal:cohen2002conforming},
and by Si \cgalCite{cgal:si2008cdt3}.


\section CT_3_definitions Definitions

In this section, we define the main concepts that have to be understood to use this package.

\subsection CT_3_PLC Piecewise Linear Complex

A _Piecewise Linear Complex_ is the 3-dimensional generalization of a planar straight-line graph.

A PLC is built from simple geometric elements, called _faces_
that are topologically connected together in a structured way.
`Faces (vertices, edges, and facets) are the basic elements forming the complex.
Their geometric counterparts are points, segments, and polygons, respectively.
The polygons can be non-convex, have holes, and as many boundary segments as needed.
Each face is embedded into the geometric space via the points coordinates.

The faces must satisfy the following conditions. They must be connected together by
their common faces of lower dimension:
- two edges can only intersect at a common vertex which is also in the PLC;
- two facets can only intersect at a common edge or vertex which is also in the PLC.

\subsection CT_3_CDT Conforming Delaunay Triangulation

The goal of the algorithms developed in this package is to compute a constrained Delaunay
mesh containing a given set of polygonal constraints in 3D as sub-complex.
See package \ref PkgTriangulation3 for more details on Delaunay triangulations.

A triangulation is a _Delaunay triangulation_ if the circumscribing sphere of any cell
of the triangulation contains no vertex in its interior.
A _constrained Delaunay triangulation_ is a constrained triangulation which is as much
Delaunay as possible, given that some facets are marked as _constrained_.
The circumscribing sphere of any cell contains in its interior no data point
which is on the same side of the constrained facet as the cell. \todo pour Laurent

In 3D, constrained triangulations do not always exist. It can be shown using the
example of the Sch&ouml;nhardt polyhedra \cgalCite{schonhardt1928zerlegung},
\cgalCite{b-ip-48a}, that requires the addition of
Steiner points to be tetrahedralizable (see Figure \cgalFigureRef{schonhardt_fig}).

Shewchuk \cgalCite{cgal:shewchuk1998condition} showed that for any PLC,
there exists another PLC that is a refined version of the original one,
that admits a constrained Delaunay triangulation.
The refined PLC is obtained by adding Steiner points on the input edges and facets,
and the constrained triangulation built on this PLC is called
a _conforming Delaunay triangulation_.

The algorithm implemented in this package is based on the work of
Hang Si \cgalCite{si2005meshing}, \cgalCite{si2015tetgen}.
Steiner points are added on input edges and input facets
of the PLC to make it tetrahedralizable.

Figure \cgalFigureRef{plc2cdt_fig} shows an example of a conforming constrained
Delaunay triangulation constructed from a PLC.

\section CT_3_api API

\subsection CT_3_api_classes Classes

This package provides one main class `Conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3`
that represents a 3D conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation.
The class is templated by the geometric traits class and the underlying triangulation class.
The other classes that are provided are secondary classes that define the
vertex and cell types and metadata that constitute the triangulation.

\subsection CT_3_api_functions Functions

Some helper constructor functions, like `make_conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3()`,
are provided to create a `Conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3` object.

\section CT_3_examples Examples

\subsection CT_3_example_ccdt Build a Conforming Constrained Delaunay Triangulation

The following example demonstrates how to use the helper constructor function
`make_conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3()` to create a
conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation from a given PLC.

\cgalExample{Constrained_triangulation_3/conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3.cpp }


\subsection CT_3_example_ccdt_soup Build a Conforming Constrained Delaunay Triangulation from a Polygon Soup

It is also possible to create a conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation
from a polygon soup, i.e., a set of polygons for which the connectivity is not known a priori.
This example demonstrates how to build such a triangulation.

\cgalExample{Constrained_triangulation_3/conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3_from_soup.cpp }


\subsection CT_3_example_ccdt_fpmap Build a Conforming Constrained Delaunay Triangulation with Known Face Patches

When the user knows a priori the set of patch ids that he wants to attach to faces, this information
can be used and kept valid through the construction of the conforming constrained
Delaunay triangulation.

The following example demonstrates how to detect surface patches separated by sharp edges
and use this surface segmentation in the tetrahedrization process.

When this parameter is used, the 3D triangulation constrained faces indices (available with
`face_constraint_index()` in `Conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_cell_data_3`)
are set to the corresponding patch ids from this map.
When it is not used, the face indices are set to different indices for each input facet.

\cgalExample{Constrained_triangulation_3/conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3_fpmap.cpp}

Figure \cgalFigureRef{ccdt_fpmap} shows the input and output of this triangulation construction example.

\subsection CT_3_example_remesh Remeshing a Conforming Constrained Delaunay Triangulation

Once the triangulation is built, it is possible to remesh it using the
`CGAL::tetrahedral_isotropic_remeshing()` function from the \ref PkgTetrahedralRemeshing package
to improve the quality of the mesh or adapt it to a given sizing field.

The following example shows how to remesh a conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation.

\section CT_3_design Implementation History

The first version of this package was implemented by Laurent Rineau, and published in 2025 in CGAL 6.1. It is based on the theoretical foundation provided by Hang Si's work on meshing algorithms
\cgalCite{si2005meshing}, \cgalCite{si2015tetgen}.
