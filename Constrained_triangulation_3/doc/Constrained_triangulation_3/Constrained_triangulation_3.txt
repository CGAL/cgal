\section CT_3_CCDT_3 Constrained Triangulations in 3D

3D triangulations partition space and are useful in many applications. In some cases, it is
important to ensure that specific faces, such as those representing sharp features, appear in the output.
When a triangulation exactly respects these constraints, it is called a _constrained_ triangulation.
However, it is sometimes only possible to preserve the geometry of the constraints, but not their exact
combinatorics. In such cases, additional points, called _Steiner_ _points_, must be inserted. This process
results in a _conforming_ triangulation.

This package implements an algorithm for constructing conforming triangulations of 3D polygonal
constraints. Specifically, it requires that these piecewise linear constraints are provided as a
_piecewise linear complex_&nbsp;(PLC). The resulting triangulations are of type `Triangulation_3`,
as described in the chapter \ref PkgTriangulation3.

The article by Cohen-Steiner et al. \cgalCite{cgal:cohen2002conforming} discusses the problem of
constructing conforming Delaunay triangulations and proposes an algorithm to address it.
Si's work \cgalCite{si2005meshing}, \cgalCite{cgal:si2008cdt3}, \cgalCite{si2015tetgen},
 presents an algorithm for computing conforming constrained
Delaunay triangulations in 3D.

\section CT_3_definitions Definitions

This section introduces the key concepts necessary to understand and use this package effectively.

\subsection CT_3_PLC Piecewise Linear Complex

A _piecewise linear complex_&nbsp;(PLC) is the three-dimensional generalization of a
planar straight-line graph. It consists of a finite set of vertices, edges, and polygons (faces)
that satisfy the following properties:

- The vertices and edges of the PLC form a simplicial complex: two edges may intersect only at a
  shared vertex.
- The boundary of each polygon (face) in the PLC is an ordered list of vertices from the PLC, forming
  one or more closed loops (for holes).
- If two polygons in the PLC intersect, their intersection is a union of edges and vertices from the
  PLC. In particular, the interiors of two polygons cannot overlap.

Polygons in a PLC may be non-convex, may have holes, and may have arbitrarily many boundary segments.

\subsection CT_3_CDT Conforming Constrained Delaunay Triangulation

The goal of the algorithms developed in this package is to compute a constrained Delaunay
triangulation that contains a given set of polygonal constraints in 3D as a subcomplex.

A triangulation is a _Delaunay triangulation_ if the circumscribing sphere of any simplex
in the triangulation contains no vertex in its interior (see chapter \ref PkgTriangulation3
for more details on Delaunay triangulations).

A _constrained Delaunay triangulation_ of a PLC is a constrained triangulation that is as close as
possible to being Delaunay, given that some faces are marked as _constrained_. More precisely, a
triangulation is _constrained Delaunay_ if, for any simplex \f$s\f$ of the triangulation, the
interior of its circumscribing sphere contains no vertex of the triangulation that is _visible_ from
any point in the interior of the simplex \f$s\f$. Two points are _visible_ if the open line segment
joining them does not intersect any polygon of the PLC, except for polygons that are coplanar with
the segment.

In 3D, constrained triangulations do not always exist. This can be demonstrated using the example of
Sch&ouml;nhardt polyhedra \cgalCite{schonhardt1928zerlegung}, \cgalCite{b-ip-48a}, which require the
addition of Steiner vertices to become tetrahedralizable (see \cgalFigureRef{CT_3_schonhardt_fig}).

Shewchuk \cgalCite{cgal:shewchuk1998condition} demonstrated that for any PLC, there exists a refined
version of the original PLC that admits a constrained Delaunay triangulation. This refinement is
achieved by adding Steiner vertices to the input edges and polygons. The constrained triangulation
built on this refined PLC is known as a _conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation_ (CCDT for short).

The algorithm implemented in this package is based on the work of Hang Si
\cgalCite{si2005meshing}, \cgalCite{cgal:si2008cdt3}, \cgalCite{si2015tetgen}.
Steiner vertices are inserted on the input edges and polygons of the PLC to
ensure it can be tetrahedralized.

Delaunay triangulation constructed from a PLC.

\section CT_3_design Software Design

\subsection CT_3_representation_of_PLCs Representation of Piecewise Linear Complexes

There is no universal or canonical way to represent all possible PLCs in \cgal.

Any polyhedral surface is a PLC, so any model of `FaceListGraph`, such as `CGAL::Surface_mesh`, can be
used to represent such a PLC.
In this representation, the faces of the PLC correspond to the faces of the
surface meshâ€”a collection of vertices (points), edges, and faces that cover the surface of a
geometric object.
In this representation, the vertices of the PLC correspond to the vertices of the surface mesh, the
edges of the PLC correspond to the edges of the surface mesh, and the polygons of the PLC correspond
to the facets of the surface mesh. However, PLCs represented in this way are limited to being
manifold (that is, each edge belongs to exactly two faces), and their faces cannot have holes.

A PLC can also be represented as a polygon soup: a collection of vertices and a set of polygons, where
each polygon is defined by an ordered list of vertices, without explicit connectivity information between
polygons. For a polygon soup to represent a valid PLC, its polygons must satisfy the properties described
in the previous section. This approach allows for the representation of non-manifold geometries; however,
polygons in a polygon soup cannot have holes.

This package also provides a way to group polygons into distinct surface patches using a property map.
Each polygon can be assigned a _patch_ identifier, allowing multiple polygons to form a continuous surface patch,
which may include holes. When these patches are planar and satisfy the necessary geometric conditions,
they can be used to construct a conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation.
When a property map is provided, the input PLC is then represented by its faces, edges and vertices as follows:
- Each face of the PLC is defined as the union of input polygons sharing the same patch identifier;
- The edges of the PLC are those belonging to the surface mesh or polygon soup that have only one
  adjacent face, specifically those marking the boundaries of patches;
- The vertices of the PLC are the ones lying at the boundaries of the surface patches in the original surface mesh or polygon soup.

\subsection CT_3_api API

This package provides a primary class, `CGAL::Conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3`.
This class is templated by a
geometric traits class and an underlying triangulation class, allowing for flexibility and
customization.

In addition to the main class, the package includes several auxiliary classes that define the types
of vertices, cells, and associated metadata used within the triangulation. These supporting classes
enable users to extend or adapt the triangulation data structure to their specific needs.

Two overloads of the constructor function \link
PkgConstrainedTriangulation3FunctionsPolygonSoupOrMesh
`CGAL::make_conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3()`\endlink are provided to facilitate the creation
of a `CGAL::Conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3` object from either a surface mesh or a polygon soup.

\section CT_3_examples Examples

\subsection CT_3_example_ccdt Build a Conforming Constrained Delaunay Triangulation

The following example illustrates how to use the helper function
`CGAL::make_conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3()` to construct a conforming constrained
Delaunay triangulation from a given PLC.

The triangulation is saved in the MEDIT file format, using the
\link PkgCDT3IOFunctions `CGAL::IO::write_MEDIT()` \endlink function.

\cgalExample{Constrained_triangulation_3/conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3.cpp }


\subsection CT_3_example_ccdt_soup Build a Conforming Constrained Delaunay Triangulation from a Polygon Soup

You can also construct a conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation from a polygon soup.
The following example demonstrates how to create such a triangulation from a collection of polygons
without explicit connectivity information.

\cgalExample{Constrained_triangulation_3/ccdt_3_from_soup.cpp }


\subsection CT_3_example_ccdt_fimap Build a Conforming Constrained Delaunay Triangulation with Known Polygon Identifiers

If the user already knows the set of polygon identifiers to associate with each PLC face, this information can be
provided and preserved throughout the construction of the conforming constrained Delaunay
triangulation.

The following example demonstrates how to detect planar surface patches and remesh them as coarsely
as possible using
\link CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::remesh_planar_patches(const TriangleMeshIn&,PolygonMeshOut&,const NamedParametersIn&,const NamedParametersOut&) `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::remesh_planar_patches()` \endlink
from the \ref PkgPolygonMeshProcessing package.
The resulting patches and segmentation are then used to build a conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation.

When the named parameter `plc_face_id` is specified, each constrained facet in the 3D triangulation
is assigned to the corresponding input PLC face, as identified by the provided property map.
If this parameter is not specified, each input polygon (or PLC face) is assigned a unique face index.

Figure \cgalFigureRef{CT_3_ccdt_examples_fig} shows the benefit of using the `plc_face_id` property map.
On the last line of the figure, the input PLC is enriched with a segmentation of the planar faces,
provided via the `plc_face_id` property map. In the resulting conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation,
only the boundary edges of the PLC faces are constrained, while the other edges never get inserted as
edges of the 3D triangulation.

Without the `plc_face_id` property map, all edges of the PLC faces are constrained,
each PLC face is considered as a constraint,
possibly resulting in a 3D triangulation with surfaces that are more refined than necessary.

\cgalExample{Constrained_triangulation_3/conforming_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3_fimap.cpp}

\cgalFigureRef{CT_3_ccdt_examples_fig} shows the input and output of this triangulation construction example.


\subsection CT_3_example_ccdt_region_growing_fimap Build a Conforming Constrained Delaunay Triangulation with Detected Polygon Identifiers

If the user does not know the set of polygon identifiers to associate with each PLC face, this information can be
automatically detected using the
\link CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::region_growing_of_planes_on_faces(const PolygonMesh& mesh,RegionMap region_map,const NamedParameters& np) `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::region_growing_of_planes_on_faces()`\endlink
function from the \ref PkgPolygonMeshProcessing package.

The following example demonstrates how to detect planar surface patches and build a conforming
constrained Delaunay triangulation using the detected segmentation. The named parameter `plc_face_id`
is used to associate each facet of the triangulation with the corresponding input PLC face.

\cgalExample{Constrained_triangulation_3/ccdt_3_fimap_region_growing.cpp}


\subsection CT_3_examples_preprocessing Preprocessing the Input for Conforming Constrained Delaunay Triangulations

Given a PLC, the algorithms in this package can construct a conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation, provided
the input surface can be represented as a valid surface mesh or a collection of surface meshes,
and does not contain self-intersections.
Several preprocessing functions are available in the \ref PkgPolygonMeshProcessing package to help ensure these
preconditions are met.

The following example demonstrates how to construct a conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation from
an input mesh that is not triangulated and may contain self-intersections,
using autorefinement.

\cgalExample{Constrained_triangulation_3/ccdt_3_after_autorefinement.cpp }

The function
\link CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::does_self_intersect(const FaceRange&, const TriangleMesh&, const NamedParameters&) `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::does_self_intersect()` \endlink
is used to detect self-intersections,
but it requires the input mesh to be triangulated. Therefore, the input mesh must first be triangulated
using
\link CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::triangulate_faces(FaceRange,PolygonMesh&,const NamedParameters&) `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::triangulate_faces()`\endlink
before performing the self-intersection check.

If self-intersections are found, the triangulated mesh is converted into a triangle soup, which is then
processed with
\link CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::autorefine_triangle_soup(PointRange&,TriangleRange&,const NamedParameters&) `CGAL::Polygon_mesh_processing::autorefine_triangle_soup()`\endlink
to resolve the self-intersections.


\subsection CT_3_example_remesh Remeshing a Conforming Constrained Delaunay Triangulation

After constructing the triangulation, you can improve its quality or adapt it to a specific sizing
field by applying the
\link CGAL::tetrahedral_isotropic_remeshing(CGAL::Triangulation_3<Traits, TDS, SLDS>&, const SizingFunction&, const NamedParameters&) `CGAL::tetrahedral_isotropic_remeshing()`\endlink
 function from the \ref PkgTetrahedralRemeshing package.

The following example demonstrates how to remesh a conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation.

\cgalExample{Constrained_triangulation_3/remesh_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_3.cpp }
