A doubly-connected edge-list (\em Dcel for short) data-structure. It consists
of three containers of records: vertices \f$ V\f$, halfedges \f$ E\f$, and faces \f$ F\f$.
It maintains the incidence relation among them. The halfedges are ordered
in pairs sometimes referred to as twins, such that each halfedge pair
represent an edge.

A model of the `GeneralPolygonSetDcel` simply refines `ArrangementDcel`,
the `Halfedge` and `Face` types being models of the concepts
`GeneralPolygonSetDcelHalfedge` and `GeneralPolygonSetDcelFace`
respectively
