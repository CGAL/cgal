\ccDefinition
%============
The class \ccRefName\ models the concept \ccc{GeneralPolygonWithHoles_2}.
It represents a linear polygon with holes. It is parameterized with two
types (\ccc{Kernel} and \ccc{Container}) that are used to instantiate
the type \ccc{CGAL::Polygon_2<Kernel,Container>}. The latter is used to
represents the outer boundary and the boundary of the holes (if any exist).
