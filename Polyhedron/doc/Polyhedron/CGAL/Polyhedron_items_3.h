The class `Polyhedron_items_3` is a model of the `PolyhedronItems_3`
concept. It provides definitions for vertices with points, halfedges,
and faces with plane equations. The polyhedron traits class must
provide the respective types for the point and the plane equation.
Vertices and facets both contain a halfedge handle to an incident
halfedge.

\cgalHeading{Example}

The following example program defines a new face class based on the
`CGAL::HalfedgeDS_face_base` and adds a new color member variable.
The new face class is used to replace the face definition in the
`CGAL::Polyhedron_items_3` class. The main function illustrates the
access to the new member variable.
See also the `PolyhedronItems_3` concept for another illustrative
example.
