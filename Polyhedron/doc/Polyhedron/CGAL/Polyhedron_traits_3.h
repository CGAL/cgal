The class `Polyhedron_traits_3` is a model of the `PolyhedronTraits_3`
concept. It defines the geometric types and primitive operations used
in the polyhedral surface data structure
`Polyhedron_3<PolyhedronTraits_3>` in terms of the \cgal `Kernel`. It keeps a local copy of the kernel which makes
it suitable for kernels with local state.

\cgalModels `PolyhedronTraits_3`

\sa `CGAL::Polyhedron_traits_with_normals_3<Kernel>`

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

Since the `PolyhedronTraits_3` concept is a subset of the
concept Kernel, this class just forwards the relevant types and access
member functions from its template argument. However, it is useful
for testing sufficiency of requirements.

\cgalHeading{Example}

Instantiation of a polyhedral surface with the
%Cartesian kernel based on double coordinates.
