  A polyhedral surface `Polyhedron_3` consists of vertices `V`,
  edges `E`, facets `F` and an incidence relation on them. Each edge is
  represented by two halfedges with opposite orientations.

  \image html halfedge.png
  \image latex halfedge.png

  Vertices represent points in 3d-space. Edges are straight line segments
  between two endpoints. Facets are planar polygons without holes
  defined by the circular sequence of halfedges along their boundary.
  The polyhedral surface itself can have holes. The halfedges
  along the boundary of a hole are called <I>border halfedges</I> and
  have no incident facet. An edge is a <I>border edge</I> if one of
  its halfedges is a border halfedge. A surface is <I>closed</I> if it
  contains no border halfedges. A closed surface is a boundary
  representation for polyhedra in three dimensions. The convention is
  that the halfedges are oriented counterclockwise around facets as seen
  from the outside of the polyhedron. An implication is that the
  halfedges are oriented clockwise around the vertices. The notion of
  the solid side of a facet as defined by the halfedge orientation
  extends to polyhedral surfaces with border edges although they do not
  define a closed object. If normal vectors are considered for the
  facets, normals point outwards (following the right hand rule).

  The strict definition can be found in \cgalCite{k-ugpdd-99}. One
  implication of this definition is that the polyhedral surface is
  always an orientable and oriented 2-manifold with border edges, i.e.,
  the neighborhood of each point on the polyhedral surface is either
  homeomorphic to a disc or to a half disc, except for vertices where
  many holes and surfaces with boundary can join. Another implication is
  that the smallest representable surface is a triangle (for polyhedral
  surfaces with border edges) or a tetrahedron (for polyhedra). Boundary
  representations of orientable 2-manifolds are closed under Euler
  operations. They are extended with operations that create or close
  holes in the surface.

  Other intersections besides the incidence relation are not allowed,
  although they are not automatically handled, since self intersections
  are not easy to check efficiently. `Polyhedron_3` does only
  maintain the combinatorial integrity of the polyhedral surface (using
  Euler operations) and does not consider the coordinates of the points
  or any geometric information.

  The class `Polyhedron_3` can represent polyhedral surfaces as
  well as polyhedra. The interface is designed in such a way that it
  is easy to ignore border edges and work only with polyhedra.

  The sequence of edges can be ordered in the data structure on request
  such that the sequence starts with the non-border edges and ends with
  the border edges. Border edges are then itself ordered such that the
  halfedge which is incident to the facet comes first and the halfedge
  incident to the hole comes thereafter. This normalization step counts
  simultaneously the number of border edges. This number is zero if and
  only if the surface is a closed polyhedron. Note that this class does
  not maintain this counter nor the halfedge order during further
  modifications. There is no automatic caching done for auxiliary
  information.

\cgalHeading{Parameters}

  The full template declaration of `Polyhedron_3` states four
  template parameters:

\code{.cpp}
template < class PolyhedronTraits_3,
           class PolyhedronItems_3 = CGAL::Polyhedron_items_3,
           template < class T, class I>
           class HalfedgeDS = CGAL::HalfedgeDS_default,
           class Alloc = CGAL_ALLOCATOR(int) >
class Polyhedron_3;
\endcode

  The first parameter requires a model of the `PolyhedronTraits_3`
  concept as argument, for example `CGAL::Polyhedron_traits_3`. The
  second parameter expects a model of the `PolyhedronItems_3`
  concept. By default, the class `CGAL::Polyhedron_items_3` is
  preselected. The third parameter is a class template. A model of the
  `HalfedgeDS` concept is expected. By default, the class
  `CGAL::HalfedgeDS_default` is preselected, which is a list based
  implementation of the halfedge data structure.
  The fourth parameter `Alloc` requires a standard allocator for
  \stl container classes. The `rebind` mechanism from `Alloc`
  will be used to create appropriate allocators internally. A default is
  provided with the macro `CGAL_ALLOCATOR(int)` from the
  `<CGAL/memory.h>` header file.

    \ingroup PkgPolyhedronRef

    A halfedge is an oriented edge
    between two vertices. It is always paired with a halfedge pointing in
    the opposite direction. The `Halfedge::opposite()` member function returns
    this halfedge of opposite orientation. If a halfedge is incident to a
    facet the `Halfedge::next()` member function points to the successor
    halfedge around this facet. For border edges the `Halfedge::next()` member
    function points to the successor halfedge along the hole. For more
    than two border edges at a vertex, the next halfedge along a hole is
    not uniquely defined, but a consistent assignment of the next halfedge
    will be maintained in the data structure. An invariant is that
    successive assignments of the form `h = h->%next()` cycle
    counterclockwise around the facet (or hole) and traverse all halfedges
    incident to this facet (or hole). A similar invariant is that successive
    assignments of the form `h = h->%next()->%opposite()` cycle
    clockwise around the vertex and traverse all halfedges incident to
    this vertex. Two circulators are provided for these circular orders.

    <center><b>The three classes `Vertex`, `Halfedge`, and `Facet` of the polyhedral surface. Member functions with shaded background are mandatory. The others are optionally supported.</b></center>

    The incidences encoded in `Halfedge::opposite()` and `Halfedge::next()` are
    available for each instantiation of polyhedral surfaces. The other
    incidences are optionally available as indicated with type tags. The
    `Halfedge::prev()` member function points to the preceding halfedge around
    the same facet. It is always available, though it might perform a
    search around the facet using the `Halfedge::next()` member function to find
    the previous halfedge if the underlying halfedge data structure does
    not provide an efficient `Halfedge::prev()` member function for halfedges.
    Handles to the incident vertex and facet are optionally stored.

    The circulators are assignable to the `Halfedge_handle`. The
    circulators are bidirectional if the halfedge provided to the
    polyhedron with the `Items` template argument provides a member
    function `Halfedge::prev()`, otherwise they are of the forward category.

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

    The member functions `Halfedge::prev()` and `Halfedge::prev_on_vertex()` work in
    constant time if `Supports_halfedge_prev` \f$ \equiv\f$
    `CGAL::Tag_true`. Otherwise both methods search for the previous
    halfedge around the incident facet.

    \name Operations with Border Halfedges

    \cgalAdvancedBegin
    Halfedges incident to a hole are called <I>border
    halfedges</I>. A halfedge is a <I>border edge</I> if itself or its
    opposite halfedge are border halfedges. The only requirement to work
    with border halfedges is that the `Halfedge` class provides a member
    function `Halfedge::is_border()` returning a `bool`. Usually, the halfedge data
    structure supports facets and a `NULL` facet pointer will indicate a
    border halfedge, but this is not the only possibility. The
    `is_border()` predicate divides the edges into two classes, the border
    edges and the non-border edges. The following normalization
    reorganizes the sequential storage of the edges such that the
    non-border edges precede the border edges, and that for each border
    edge the latter one of the two halfedges is a border halfedge (the
    first one is a non-border halfedge in conformance with the polyhedral
    surface definition). The normalization stores the number of border
    halfedges and the halfedge iterator the border edges start at within
    the data structure. Halfedge insertion or removal and changing the
    border status of a halfedge invalidate these values. They are not
    automatically updated.
