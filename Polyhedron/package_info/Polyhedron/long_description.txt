Three Package
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-  CGAL/Polyhedron_3.h

     Polyhedral surfaces in 3D based on HalfedgeDS.

-  CGAL/Polyhedron_iterator_3.h

     Iterator and circulator used for polyhedral surfaces (and maybe
     other data structures based on the halfedge data structure as well.

-  CGAL/Polyhedron_traits_3.h

     A default traits class for polyhedral surfaces based on the
     CGAL-kernel.

-  CGAL/Polyhedron_traits_with_normals_3.h

     A traits class replacing the plane equation per facet with a 
     normal vector per facet.

-  CGAL/Polyhedron_incremental_builder_3.h

     An incremental builder useful when creating polyhedral surfaces 
     from file formats.

-  CGAL/Polyhedron_copy_3.h

     A modifier able of copying or appending polyhedral surfaces.
