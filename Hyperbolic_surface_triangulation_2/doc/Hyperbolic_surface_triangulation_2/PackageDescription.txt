\cgalPkgDesc{This package enables handling and building triangulations of closed orientable hyperbolic surfaces. A method is offered that implements the Delaunay flip algorithm on such triangulations. Triangulations can be generated by triangulating a convex fundamental domain in the Poincaré disk model. A method is offered that generates such domains in genus two.}

\cgalCRPSection{Concepts}

- `HyperbolicSurfacesTraits_2` describes the requirements for triangulations, convex fundamental domains, and isometries of the Poincaré disk modeL

\cgalCRPSection{Classes}

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Surface_triangulation_2` is the main class of the Hyperbolic Surface Triangulation package. It represents a triangulation of a closed orientable hyperbolic surface. It offers factilities such as the generation of the triangulation from a convex fundamental domain, the Delaunay flip algorithm, and the construction of a portion of the lift of the triangulation in the Poincaré disk model.

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_fundamental_domain_2` represents a convex fundamental domain in the Poincaré disk model. The domain is a convex polygon given by the list of its vertices, and a pairing of the sides of the polygon. A method is offered that computes the isometry sending a side to its paired side.

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_fundamental_domain_factory_2` randomly generates convex fundamental domains of closed orientable hyperbolic surfaces of genus two.

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_isometry_2` represents an isometry in the Poincaré disk model. Facilities are offered to compose isometries, and apply an isometry to a point.

- `CGAL::Complex_without_sqrt` represents a complex number.

A model for the concept `HyperbolicSurfacesTraits_2` is provided:
- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_surfaces_traits_2` is templated by a fiel type FT and guarantees exact constructions for input points with coordinates in FT.
