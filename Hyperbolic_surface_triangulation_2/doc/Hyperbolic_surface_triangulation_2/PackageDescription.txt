\cgalPkgDesc{This package enables handling and building triangulations of closed orientable hyperbolic surfaces. Facilities are offered such as the Delaunay flip algorithm, and the construction of a portion of the lift of the triangulation in the Poincaré disk model of the hyperbolic plane. Triangulations can be generated by triangulating a convex fundamental domain in the Poincaré disk model. A method is offered that generates such domains in genus two.}

\cgalCRPSection{Concepts}

- `HyperbolicSurfacesTraits_2` describes the set of requirements to be fulfilled by any class instantiating the template parameter of most classes of the package.

\cgalCRPSection{Classes}

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_surface_triangulation_2` represents a triangulation of a closed orientable hyperbolic surface. Offers facilities such as the generation of the triangulation from a convex fundamental domain, the Delaunay flip algorithm, and the construction of a portion of the lift of the triangulation in the hyperbolic plane.

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_fundamental_domain_2` represents a fundamental domain of a closed orientable hyperbolic surface.

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_fundamental_domain_factory_2` is a factory class, whose only purpose is to randomly generate some convex domains of surfaces of genus two.

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_isometry_2` represents an isometry in the Poincaré disk model. Facilities are offered to compose isometries, and apply an isometry to a point.

- `CGAL::Complex_without_sqrt` represents a complex number.

A model for the concept `HyperbolicSurfacesTraits_2` is provided:
- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_surfaces_traits_2` inherits from its template parameter HyperbolicTraitsClass. HyperbolicTraitsClass must be a model of  `CGAL::HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2`.
