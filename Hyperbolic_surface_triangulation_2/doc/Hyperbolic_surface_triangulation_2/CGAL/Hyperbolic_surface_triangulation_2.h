\ingroup PkgHyperbolicSurfaceTriangulation2MainClasses

Represents a triangulation of a closed orientable hyperbolic surface.

Offers facilities such as the generation of the triangulation from a convex fundamental domain,
the Delaunay flip algorithm, and the construction of a portion of the lift of the triangulation in the hyperbolic plane.

\tparam Traits is the traits class and must be a model of `HyperbolicSurfacesTraits`.
