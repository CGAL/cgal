\ccPkgSummary{
This package provides functions to generate
surface  meshes that interpolate
smooth surfaces. The  meshing algorithm is based on Delaunay
refinement and provides some guarantees on the resulting mesh:
the user is able to control the size and shape of the mesh
elements and  the accuracy of the surface approximation.
There is no restriction on the topology and number of components
of input surfaces. The surface mesher may also be used
for non smooth surfaces but without guarantee.

Currently, implementations
are provided for implicit surfaces described as the zero level set
of some function and surfaces described as a gray
level set in a three-dimensional image.}
