13 September 2006 Laurent Rineau
- massive fix of const-correctness in Surface_mesher, Mesh_3,
Head_mesher dans Data_structure_for_queries_3.
  (A nice feature of C++ is that, when you need to add *one* const
   somewhere, then you have to fix const-correctness of all the World!)

10 August 2006 Laurent Rineau
- added a public member function
    Bbox bbox() const;
  to Polyhedral_surface_3<>.
- make make_surface_mesh() take the surface by reference, to avoid copies.
- in demo/Surface_mesher:
   - merge parameters.* with the Mesh_3 version,
   - use <CGAL/Surface_mesh_default_triangulation_3.h>
   - new polyhedron_remesher.cpp
- use Robust_circumcenter_traits_3<K> by default, in
  Surface_mesh_default_triangulation_3

9 August 2006 Laurent Rineau
- documentation of Surface_mesh_default_triangulation_3
- big cleaning of examples/Surface_mesher/

28 July 2006 Laurent Rineau
- fix last patch: the vertex iterator class needs a little more sugar
(thanks to Mariette how spotted this out).
- extend the testsuite to check that

26 July 2006 Laurent Rineau
- fix a bug: c2t3::Vertex_iterator should be convertible to Vertex_handle,
  as usuall vertex iterators of CGAL triangulations.

12 July 2006 Laurent Rineau
- fixed i/o operators, in binary mode, for C2t3_cell_base_3, 
- fixed input operator of c2t3. It know deals correctly (I hope), with the
  edge_facets_counter member.
- added a new class Surface_mesh_default_triangulation_3
- use Surface_mesh_default_triangulation_3 in test_c2t3_iterators.cpp, as a
  test.
- fixed i/o operators, in binary mode, of Point_with_surface_index and
  Weighted_point_with_surface_index


10 July 2006 Laurent Rineau
- remove a buguy debug output, in
include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Point_surface_indices_oracle_visitor.h
- add a new macro CGAL_MESHES_DEBUG_REFINEMENT_POINTS (see Mesh_2 changelog
too) in <CGAL/Surface_mesher/Surface_mesher.h>
- major switch from .C to .cpp. Andreas's script left a lot of things that
had to be fixed manually.
- new debug macro in <CGAL/Surface_mesher/Standard_criteria.h>
  - CGAL_MESH_3_DEBUG_CRITERIA
  Used in test/Mesh_3/combined_spheres*.cpp 

6 July 2006 Laurent Rineau
- fix typos in make_surface_mesh.tex.
- in Surface_mesher_ref/intro.tex, change "Global Functions" to
  "Function Templates", and capitalize "Tag classes" to "Tag Classes"
(This patch will be submitted in the CGAL-3.2.x branch.)

5 July 2006 Laurent Rineau
- move Point_traits.h from Mesh_3 to Surface_mesher, to avoid an unneeded
dependancy
- fix the oracle Sphere_oracle_3
- added a test in Surfacer_mesher

28 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- extends Robust_circumcenter_traits_3 so that this class is model of
ConstructCicumcenter_3.
- fix operator>> for c2t3, so that number_of_facets is computed correctly.

26 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- in Surface_mesher:
  - remove deprecated include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Implicit_surface.h
  - rename CGAL::Surface_mesher::Implicit_surface_oracle to
           CGAL::Surface_mesher::Implicit_surface_oracle_3
    and then, rename include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Implicit_surface_oracle.h
    to include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Implicit_surface_oracle_3.h
- in Mesh_3: adapt code to the above change.

23 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- fix all iterators of C2t3!!
- added a test to test that these iterators works...

12 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- remove subdirectories of include/CGAL/Surface_mesher: files of Criteria/
  and Oracles/ are moved one step back.
- repear the polyhedral oracle
- Implicit_oracle.h is now Implicit_surface_oracle.h (and the class has
been renamed too.
- no longer "Kernel_point" trick in Implicit_surface_oracle.h
- *but* "Kernel_point" trick is needed in Polyhedral_oracle.h! :-(

7 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- sliver exuder fixed,
- Combining_oracle fixed too.

6 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- remove the old code Multi_implicit_oracle.h (in Surface_Mesher), and
multi_spheres.C (in Mesh_3).

6 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- merge trunk modifications into the branch "cannot_wait_for_CGAL-3.2"
  I will copy the branch into the trunk.

  Here are the changes:
    21 April 2006 Laurent Rineau
    - the patch of 15 April broke examples.
    - s/ZLIB/CGAL_USE_ZLIB/
    - ugly hack: need to include <CGAL/compiler_config.h> in imageio.h!
    
    20 April 2006 Laurent Rineau
    - minor fixes in the documentation, after the second review of Efi.
    
    15 April 2006 Laurent Rineau
    - try to fix compilation problem with gcc-3.3, in
      test/Surface_mesher/implicit_surface_mesher_test.C
        (I am not sure to well understand this problem.)
      (added 16th of April: actually it fixed the compilation problem.)
    
    7 April 2006 Laurent Rineau
    - added a picture for the sphere example, in manual.
    - modified the bounds for the skull example: with previous bounds (10 and
      10), the resulting mesh was not manifold.
    
4 May 2006 Laurent Rineau
- in include/CGAL/Complex_2_in_triangulation_3.h, removed 20% lignes of
  code:
    - remove adjacent_facets(...) (unused)
    - in set_in_complex(Facet), merge cases dimension()==3 with
      dimension()==2.
    - merge remove_from_complex(...) code with set_in_complex(...), using a
      template boolean parameter.
- added incident_facets(Vertex_handle v, OutputIterator facets) to the
  specifications of SurfaceMeshComplex_2InTriangulation_3
- added operator<< and operator>> for Complex_2_in_triangulation_3<Tr>

3 May 2006 Laurent Rineau
- in include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Implicit_oracle.h:
  - remove a "const", before the point can be modified by the visitor, if
  any.

1 May 2006 Laurent Rineau
- patch to ImageIO, to fix "unused variable" warnings.
- added support for "Input/Ouput signature" (see include/CGAL/Mesh_3/IO.h)
- better debugging output for
  include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Surface_mesher_regular_edges.h, with macros
  CGAL_SURFACE_MESHER_DEBUG_CONSTRUCTORS and CGAL_SURFACE_MESHER_VERBOSE.
- fix a bug in include/CGAL/Surface_mesh_cell_base_3.h: due to the
  Rebind_TDS mecanism, Complex_2_in_triangulation_cell_base_3 was base
  class twice!
- remove <CGAL/Delaunay_triangulation_3.h>

7 April 2006 Laurent Rineau
- added a picture for the sphere example, in manual.
- modified the bounds for the skull example: with previous bounds (10 and
  10), the resulting mesh was not manifold.

6 April 2006 Laurent Rineau
- better test case with two spheres (I changed the radii and centers), in
  the testsuite.
- fix the classes Surface_mesh_cell_base_3 and
  Complex_2_in_triangulation_cell_base_3, so that Surface_mesh_cell_base_3
  corresponds to its documentation (the default base class was hidding the
  problem).
- remove an unused code, in Surface_mesher (check_visits)
- change to include/CGAL/Weighted_point_with_surface_index.h, used by
  Mesh_3 only.
- the ImplicitFunction concept now has a operator()(Point), instead of
  operator()(FT, FT, FT). This implied the modification of:
    - the Gray_level_image_3 and its documentation Gray_level_image_3.tex
    (new template parameter, to have the type of point),
    - all examples or demo,
    - Mesh_3 examples or demo as well

  This modification was mandatory, before the CGAL-3.2 release, to avoid
  Implicit_surface to use methods x(), y() and z() of points.

  Fully tested, etc.
- Performance issue, in Standard_criteria.h:
  Quality were not defined correctly, and then facets were not ordered
  correctly, in the Double_map.
- If the center of the bounding sphere is not in the volume, take another
one, randomly in the sphere.
- Make surf_equation non private, for Mesh_3, in Implicit_oracle.h

5 April 2006 Laurent Rineau
- demo now output an off file, probably non oriented.
- Mesh_3/application/off_to_medit.C helps to convert it to a medit file.

29 March 2006 Laurent Rineau
- New "#ifdef CGAL_USE_CORE/#endif" around the use of CORE, in
  test/Surface_mesher/implicit_surface_mesher_test.C
- Patch to ImageIO to kill warnings of SunCC. ImageIO was a C library but
  is compiled by a C++ compiler. It needs adjustments.

28 March 2006 Andreas Fabri
- Replaced #ifdef WIN32 with #ifdef _MSC_VER in ImageIO.c

23 March 2006 Laurent Rineau
- new version, more didactic, of
  examples/Surface_mesher/3d_image_surface_mesher.C
- killed warnings in ImageIO
- updated test parameters
- the handle of bad edges, in
  include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Surface_mesher_regular_edges.h, is now lazy,
  like in Surface_mesher_manifold.h
- include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Surface_mesher_regular_edges_with_boundary.h 
  now longer exists: Surface_mesher_regular_edges is templated by a
  boolean (see the code)
- fix efficiency errors in Surface_mesher_manifold.h
- the teaser picture of the doc is now centered in HTML too
- added a demo, even if it is not ready
  If somebody or the release manager do not agree with that, I will
  "dont_submit" it. So "Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace!" :-)

22 March 2006 Laurent Rineau
- fix doc_tex/Surface_mesher_ref/ImplicitSurfaceTraits_3.tex after the
  changes of yesterday
- forgot to tell that FT must be constructible from a double
- fix the std::cerr everywhere: better use of the macro
  CGAL_SURFACE_MESHER_VERBOSE
- fix the (bool debug, bool verbose) parameters of
  Surface_mesher::refine_mesh. It is now template parameters of the class
  Surface_mesher. I have verified that the optimizer of GNU/CC is able to
  strip the debug code when NO_DEBUG is use.
- change sligthly the code of examples, and modify sligthly the user manual
  accordingly
- change the way the parameter error_bound of the constructor of
  Implicit_Surface_3 is multiplied by the radius of the bounding sphere.
- added explanation of parameter error_bound of the constructor of
  Implicit_Surface_3, in its ref page
- change some bug messages in
  include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Implicit_oracle.h
- add a case in the testsuite

21 March 2006 Laurent Rineau
- fix examples/Surface_mesher/3d_image_surface_mesher.C (stupid bug: the
  bounding sphere and the criteria were copy-pasted from
  implicit_surface_mesher.C and were unappropriate.
- changes template parameters of all classes
  include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Surface_mesher*.h and update of
  include/CGAL/make_surface_mesh.h
- Fix the compilation error on Windows compilers.
  BUG explanation: there was a typedef name SMREB in
  Surface_mesher_regular_edges.h and SMREB was also the name of a template
  parameter of Surface_mesher_regular_edges.h.
- Change the compilation process of ImageIO, to be cross-platform

20 March 2006 Laurent Rineau
- fix include/CGAL/Gray_level_image_3.h
- added a CGAL::Timer to test/Surface_mesher/implicit_surface_mesher_test.C
  and fixed a warning ("FT(1)" instead of "1")
- new version of include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Implicit_oracle.h that
  now uses include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Sphere_oracle_3.h

17 March 2006 Laurent Rineau
- modified examples/Surface_mesher/makefile, to have ImageIO compiled on
  Sun
- added examples/Surface_mesher/cgal_test, so that the testsuite does not
  try to compile and run examples/Surface_mesher/implicit_functions
- try to workaround ICL and VC++ 8 bug (or not bug, I do not know), in
  include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Surface_mesher_manifold.h
- added a new class include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Sphere_oracle_3.h
  and a specialization Surface_mesh_traits_generator_3<CGAL::Sphere_3<Kernel> >
- updated test test/Surface_mesher/implicit_surface_mesher_test.C to test
  the meshing of Kernel::Sphere_3(ORIGIN, 1.)

15 March 2006 Laurent Rineau
- Added macro CGAL_SURFACE_MESHER_DEBUG_CONSTRUCTORS to strace constructors
  calls of classes in include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Surface_mesher*.h
- Added a test file test/Surface_mesher/internal-test-surface-mesher.C for
  Andreas

14 March 2006 Joachim Reichel
- Added/fixed CGAL_MAKEFILE= line in makefiles

10 March 2006  Mariette
- doc fixes

10 March 2006 Laurent Rineau
- first correct version of SurfaceMeshTraingulation_3.tex
- removed unused Tr::* typedefs everywhere
- renamed Triangulation::XXXX_iterator to
  Triangulation::Finite_XXXs_iterator in C2t3.

9 March 2006 Laurent Rineau
- modification of Complex_2_in_triangulation_vertex_base_3 and
  Complex_2_in_triangulation_3: the result of
  union_find_of_incident_facets() is cached in the vertex.
- remove unwanted verbose output. It is now activable by defining
  the preprocessor macro CGAL_SURFACE_MESHER_VERBOSE.


8 March 2006 Laurent Rineau
- change some hard-coded "double" to "FT"
- change face_type() to face_status() in users of C2t3

     - Surface_mesher_regular_edges_without_boundary_base
     - Surface_mesher_regular_edges_base
     - Surface_mesher_manifold_base
- new classes Surface_mesher_manifold, urface_mesher_regular_edges and
  Surface_mesher_regular_edges_without_boundary, that are no longer
  copy-pasted from Surface_mesher.
- rename all triangulation objects to "tr", and all geom_traits objects to
  "gt". No longer "tri3", or "ker".
- updated the target "depends" of GNUmakefile files.
- testsuite compiles, but runtime problem in manifold version. Non manifold
  runs correctly.
- fix layout of this changes.txt file

8 March 2006 Mariette Yvinec
- changed the booleans in Complex_2_in_triangulation_vertex_base_3
- changes  in Complex_2_in_triangulation_3 :
   - remove set_in_complex and remove_from_complex for vertices

   - added is_regular_or_boundary_for_vertices


2 March 2006 Laurent Rineau
(WARNING: partially compiles, runtime errors, temporary commit)
- Added an undocumented class Surface_mesh_triangulation_generator_3 which
  is a meta functor Kernel->Triangulation, that computes the right
  triangulation for make_surface_mesh()
- Added documented files:
    - include/CGAL/Implicit_surface_3.h
    - include/CGAL/Surface_mesh_default_criteria_3.h
    - include/CGAL/Surface_mesh_complex_2_in_triangulation_3.h
- In doc, rename: 
    - SurfaceMeshCriteria to SurfaceMeshCriteria_3
    - Surface_mesh_default_criteria to Surface_mesh_default_criteria_3
- Added doc_tex GNUmakefile, for developers uses.

- Wrote the first test file!
- Find Triangulation_mesher_level_traits_3.h in include/CGAL/Mesh_2/, now.
- Major changes in template arguments, data members, and constructors of:
  - class Surface_mesher,
  - class Implicit_oracle,
- Minor changes everywhere (sorry for the imprecision, too long).

27 february 2006 Laurent Rineau
(WARNING: no longer compiles, temporary commit)
- Added number_of_facets() to C2T3 (code and documentation)
- Remove Complex_2_in_triangulation_3_surface_meshe.h (not finished)
- Created classes Surface_mesh_cell_base_3 and Surface_mesher_vertex_base_3.
- Beginning to changes code to bo sync with the documentation.
- Remove old headers Nodes.h and Graph.h


20 janvier 2006 Mariette Yvinec
- changed the reference page manual according to Efi comments + various
  discussions.
- still missing : the concept SurfaceMeshTriangulation_3


17 janvier 2006 Mariette Yvinec
- changed in the doc PureComplex_2InTriangulation_3 to
  SurfaceMeshComplex_2InTriangulation_3 and
  Pure_complex_2_in_triangulation_3.tex to
  Surface_mesh_complex_2_in_triangulation_3.tex

9 December 2005 Andreas Fabri
- Replaced arrays of bool with a char and bit operations
- Moved CGAL/Complex_2_in_triangulation_surface_mesh_cell_base_3.h
  to CGAL/Surface_mesher/Surface_mesh_cell_base_3.h

1 December 2005 Andreas Fabri
- Putting const& in the Implicit_oracle
- Made Implicit_oracle::intersect_segment_surface_rec(Point p1, Point p2)
  non-recursive
- Replaced handwritten code with usage of  TDS_3::mirror_facet

30 November 2005 Andreas Fabri
- Introduced lazy initialization of treatment of singular vertices
- Introduced a method for determining if a vertex is in the complex, 
  as face_type computation would trigger the lazy initialization
- Removed the graph in the vertices for computing whether the vertex is
  singular
- Removed the facet status field and its set/get method
- Renamed complex_subface_type by face_type
- Replaced functions that return a list with functions that write in output
  iterators
- Replaced the "visits" that counted with a visited that only stores a bool
  as there was only an inc and reset method, and the comparison with 0
- Lots of small cleanup as proposed in TODO


4 november 2005 Laurent Rineau
- new output/input operators in:
    include/CGAL/Complex_2_in_triangulation_cell_base_3.h
    include/CGAL/Complex_2_in_triangulation_surface_mesh_cell_base_3.h
    include/CGAL/Point_with_surface_index.h
    include/CGAL/Weighted_point_with_surface_index.h
  This permits to save/load meshes with i/o operators of Triangulation_3.

3 novembre 2005 Mariette Yvinec
- surface mesher is now on cgal cvs serveur
- added in doc_tex the specifications of Complex_2_in Triangulation_3
  although they do not correspond to the code developped by David

14 september 2005 Mariette Yvinec
  - put package Surface_mesher on cgal local cvs serveur

2 september 2005 Laurent Rineau
- in Surface_mesher:
    - new file include/CGAL/Point_with_surface_index_geom_traits.h to have
      one class per file.
    - new files:
        include/CGAL/Weighted_point_with_surface_index.h
        include/CGAL/Point_with_surface_index_geom_traits.h
      so that CGAL::Weighted_point_with_surface_index<Weighted_point> can
      have several additional constructors with Bare_point parameters.
    - two important hacks in files:
        include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Polyhedral.h
        include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Implicit_oracle.h

      1/ Use of a new typedef Kernel_point, obtained by Kernel_traits, so
      these two classes work with Point_with_surface_index<Point> and
      Weighted_point_with_surface_index<Weighted_point>. Some assign
      statement has to be used with a Kernel_point, so that they do not
      fail systematicaly (assign sucks!).

      2/ Use of CGAL::Random_points_in_sphere_3<Point, Point_creator> in
      include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Implicit_oracle.h in function
      random_points(), so that this function does not use the contructor
      Point(double x, double y, double z). This implied that the tenmplate
      Implicit_oracle had a new template parameter, Point_creator, which I
      gave default
            Creator_uniform_3<typename GT::RT, typename GT::Point_3>.
      With Point_with_surface_index<Point> and
      Weighted_point_with_surface_index<Weighted_point> this creator should
      be defined. See ../Mesh_3/test/Mesh_3/combined_spheres.C and   
      ../Surface_mesher/examples/Surface_mesher/surfaces_union.C
    - same problem, file
        include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Point_surface_indices_visitor.h
      has been changed: Point_surface_indices_visitor<Tr> now has a
      templated new_point() function, so that is can take Kernel_point or
      Point as argument.
    - minor changes:
        - include/CGAL/IO/Complex_2_in_triangulation_3_file_writer.h now has
          correct copyright and #ifdef sentinel
        - include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Multi_implicit_oracle.h now
          has correct copyright
        - rename DT_3 into Tr, and GT_3 into Geom_traits in file
          include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Polyhedral.h
    - updated examples/Surface_mesher/surfaces_union.C so that it works.

TODO: - fix include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Multi_implicit_oracle.h as
        regards Kernel_point stuff
      - merge it with include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Implicit_oracle.h

- in Mesh_3:
    - include/CGAL/IO/File_medit.h :
        - fix namespace !!
        - some functions now takes a C2T3 as argument, now that C2T3 has a
        triangulation() getter.
        - new function input_pslg_from_medit() !! It reads indices.
        - output_pslg_to_medit() now uses surface_index() too 
    - new implementation of CGAL::Point_traits.h

18 august 2005 Laurent Rineau
- Complex_2_in_triangulation_3 now has an accessor:
    Triangulation_3& triangulation()

15 august 2005 Laurent Rineau
- in Surface_mesher: new Combining_oracle, and Oracle_visitor,
- in Mesh_3: test/Mesh_3/combined_spheres tests that new oracle.

28 july 2005 LR MY
- fixed the add_node() for memory leaks in Graph.h
- fixed the face_type() for edges in Complex_2_in_triangulation_3.h

27 July 2005 LR MY
- changed some named
- multi_implicit_oracle added


19 July 2005 Laurent Rineau
Change in examples/Surface_mesher/surface_mesher.C :
- added a macro SURFACE_MESHER_POLYHEDRAL. If defined, the polyhedral
version is compiled.
- change of makefile (and .cvsignore), so that two versions
implicit_surface_mesher and polyhedral_surface_mesher are built by make
all.

19 July 2005 Laurent Rineau
Minor changes:
- use mirror_facet, from Triangulation_3. Introduced in CGAL_3_2_I_146.
