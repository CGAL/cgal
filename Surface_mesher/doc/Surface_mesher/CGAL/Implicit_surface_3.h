\ingroup PkgSurfaceMesher3Classes

The class `Implicit_surface_3` implements a surface described
as the zero level
set of a function \f$ f : \mathbb{R}^3 \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}\f$.

For this type of surface, the library provides a partial specialization
of the surface mesher traits generator:
`Surface_mesh_traits_generator_3<Implicit_surface_3<Traits, Function> >`,
that provides a traits class, model of the concept
`SurfaceMeshTraits_3`,
to be used by the surface mesher.

\tparam Traits must be a geometric traits class that must be a model of
`ImplicitSurfaceTraits_3`. That concept defines all the types, predicates
and constructors that the `Traits` has to provide to implement the surface
mesh traits
 `Surface_mesh_traits_generator_3<Implicit_surface_3<Traits, Function> >`.


\tparam Function must be a of the concept `ImplicitFunction`.

The number type `Function::FT` has to match
the type `Traits::FT`.

/*!
`f` is the object of type `Function` that represents the implicit
surface.

`bounding_sphere` is a bounding sphere of the implicit surface. The
evaluation of `f` at the center `c` of this sphere must be
negative: \f$ f(c)<0\f$.

`error_bound` is a relative error bound
used to compute intersection points between the implicit surface
and query segments. This bound is used in the default generated traits class.
In this traits class, the intersection points between
the surface and segments/rays/line are constructed by dichotomy. The
dichotomy is stopped when the size of the intersected
segment is less than the product of `error_bound` by the
radius of `bounding_sphere`.
