\brief A \f$ d\f$-dimensional range tree stores points and can be used to determine all
points that lie inside a given \f$ d\f$-dimensional interval.

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

The construction of a \f$ d\f$-dimensional range tree takes \f$ {O}(n\log n^{d-1})\f$
time. The points in
the query window are reported in time \f$ {O}(k+{\log}^d n )\f$, where \f$ k\f$
is the number of reported points.
The tree uses \f$ {O}(n\log n^{d-1})\f$ storage.

/*!

A range tree is
constructed, such that the subtree of each vertex is of the
same type prototype
`sublayer_tree` is.

We assume that the dimension of the tree is \f$ d\f$. This means, that
`sublayer_tree` is a prototype of a \f$ d-1\f$-dimensional
tree. All data items of the \f$ d\f$-dimensional range tree
have container type `Data`. The query window of the
tree has container type
`Window`. `Traits`
provides access to the corresponding data slots of container
`Data` and `Window` for the \f$ d\f$-th
dimension. The traits class `Traits`
must at least provide all functions and type definitions
as described in, for example, the reference page for
`tree_point_traits`.
The template class
described there is fully generic and should fulfill the most
requirements one can have.
In order
to generate a one-dimensional range tree instantiate `Tree_anchor<Data, Window> sublayer_tree` with the same template parameters (`Data` and
`Window`) `Range_tree_d` is defined. In
order to construct a two-dimensional range tree, create
`Range_tree_d` with
a one-dimensional `Range_tree_d` with the
corresponding `Traits` class of the first dimension.
