\ingroup PkgEnvelope2Concepts
\cgalConcept

This concept defines the representation of an envelope diagram of a set
of planar curve. The <I>envelope diagram</I> is a subdivision of the \f$ x\f$-axis
into 0-dimensional cells (<I>vertices</I>) and 1-dimensional cells
(<I>edges</I>), such that the identity of the curves that induce the lower
envelope (or the upper envelope) over each cell is fixed.

A vertex in an envelope diagram is therefore associated with a point
on the envelope, and corresponds to either a curve endpoint
or to an intersection point of two (or more) curves. Therefore each vertex
is associated with a set of \f$ x\f$-monotone curves that induce the envelope
over this point. Each vertex is incident to two edges, one lying to its
left and the other to its right.

An edge in the envelope diagram represents a continuous portion of the
\f$ x\f$-axis, and is associated with a (possibly empty) set of curves that
induce the envelope over this portion of the \f$ x\f$-axis. An edge may be bounded
by two vertices, one to its left and the other to its right. However, the
diagram contains two unbounded edges, its <I>leftmost</I> edge, representing
the interval \f$ (-\infty, x_l)\f$, and its <I>rightmost</I> edge, representing the
interval \f$ (x_r, \infty)\f$, where \f$ x_l\f$ and \f$ x_r\f$ are the \f$ x\f$-coodinates of
the leftmost and the rightmost vertices in the diagram, respectively.
Note that a diagram may contain no vertices at all, in which case it
comprises a single edge.

Note that any model of the `EnvelopeDiagram_1` concept must define a geometric
traits class, which in turn defines the `Point_2` and
`X_monotone_curve_2` types defined with the diagram features.
