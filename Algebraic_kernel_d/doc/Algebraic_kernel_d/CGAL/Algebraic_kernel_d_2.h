\ingroup PkgAlgebraicKernelDModels

This class gathers necessary tools for solving and handling bivariate
polynomial systems of general degree \f$ d\f$.

This class is based on an algorithm computing a
geometric-topological analysis of a single curve \cite ekw-fast-07 and of a
pair of curves \cite ek-exact-08.
The main idea behind both analyses is to compute the critical
x-coordinates of curves and curve pairs by projection (resultants), and compute
additional information about the critical fibers using subresultants
and Sturm-Habicht sequences \cite grlr-sturm-habicht-98.
With that information, the fiber at
critical x-coordinates is computed by a variant of the Bitstream
Descartes method.
See also \cite kerber-phd-09 for a comprehensive description of
these techniques.

A point \f$ p\f$ of type `Algebraic_real_2` is represented
by its \f$ x\f$-coordinate \f$ x_0\f$ (as described in the `Algebraic_kernel_d_1`
paragraph above), an algebraic curve where \f$ p\f$ lies on, and an
integer \f$ i\f$, denoting that \f$ p\f$ is the \f$ i\f$th point in the fiber at \f$ x_0\f$,
counted from the bottom (ignoring a possible vertical line at \f$ x_0\f$).
This determines the point uniquely, but the \f$ y\f$-coordinate
is not stored internally in terms of an `Algebraic_real_1` object.
Querying such a representation by calling `Compute_y_2` is a
time-consuming step, and should be avoided for efficiency reasons if possible.
Note that this representation is not exposed in the interface.

The template argument `Coeff` determines the coefficient type of the
kernel, which is also the innermost coefficient type of the supported polynomials.

Currently, the following coefficient types are supported:
- `Gmpz`, `Gmpq`, (requires configuration with external libraries GMP, MPFR and MPFI)
- `CORE::BigInt`, `CORE::BigRat`, (requires configuration with external library GMP)
- `leda_integer`, `leda_rational`. (requires configuration with external library LEDA)
.

\cgalAdvancedBegin
The template argument type can also be set to
`Sqrt_extension<NT,ROOT>`, where `NT` is one of the types listed
above. `ROOT` should be one of the integer types.  See also the
documentation of `Sqrt_extension<NT,ROOT>`.
