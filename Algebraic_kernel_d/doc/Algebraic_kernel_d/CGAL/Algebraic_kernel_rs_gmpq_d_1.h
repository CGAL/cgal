\anchor Algebraic_kernel_rs_gmpq_d_1

This univariate algebraic kernel uses the Rs library to perform
rational univariate polynomial root isolation. It is a model of the
`AlgebraicKernel_d_1` concept. Due to the fact that RS can only
isolate integer polynomials, the operations of this kernel have the
overhead of converting the polynomials to integer.
