\brief The class `Residue` represents a finite field \f$ \mathbb{Z}{/p\mathbb{Z}}\f$,
for some prime number \f$ p\f$.

The prime number \f$ p\f$ is stored in a static member variable.
The class provides static member functions to change this value.
However, already existing objects do not lose their value with respect to the
old prime and can be reused after restoring the old prime.
Since the type is based on double
arithmetic the prime is restricted to values less than \f$ 2^{26}\f$.
The initial value of \f$ p\f$ is 67108859.

\attention Note that changing the prime invalidates already existing objects
of this type.

\cgalAdvancedBegin
The default primes \f$ p\f$ satisfy the additional property that \f$ 2\f$ is a
primitive root of unity of maximum order (i.e., \f$ p-1\f$) in \f$ \mathbb{Z}{/p\mathbb{Z}}\f$.
Equivalently, \f$ 2\f$ generates the multiplicative group \f$ (\mathbb{Z}{/p\mathbb{Z}})^\times\f$.
\cgalAdvancedEnd

Please note that the implementation of class `Residue` requires a mantissa
precision according to the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754).
However, on some processors the traditional FPU uses an extended precision. Hence, it
is indispensable that the proper mantissa length is enforced before performing
any arithmetic operations. Moreover, it is required that numbers are rounded to the
next nearest value. This can be ensured using `Protect_FPU_rounding` with
`CGAL_FE_TONEAREST`, which also enforces the required precision as a side effect.

In case the flag `CGAL_HAS_THREADS`
is undefined the prime is just stored in a static member
of the class, that is, `Residue` is not thread-safe in this case.
In case `CGAL_HAS_THREADS`
the implementation of the class is thread safe using
`boost::thread_specific_ptr`. However, this may cause some performance
penalty. Hence, it may be advisable to configure \cgal with
`CGAL_HAS_NO_THREADS`.   See Section  \ref Preliminaries_thread_safety "Thread Safety"
in the preliminaries.
