An algebraic structure is called `Modularizable`, if there is a suitable mapping
into an algebraic structure which is based on the type `CGAL::Residue`.
For scalar types, e.g. Integers, this mapping is just the canonical homomorphism
into the type `CGAL::Residue` with respect to the current prime.
For compound types, e.g. Polynomials,
the mapping is applied to the coefficients of the compound type.

The mapping is provided via `CGAL::Modular_traits<Modularizable>`,
being a model of `ModularTraits`.

Note that types representing rationals, or types which do have some notion
of denominator, are not `Modularizable`.
This is due to the fact that the denominator may be zero modulo the prime,
which can not be represented.

\cgalHasModel `int`
\cgalHasModel `long`
\cgalHasModel `CORE::BigInt`
\cgalHasModel `CGAL::Gmpz`
\cgalHasModel `leda_integer`
\cgalHasModel `mpz_class`

The following types are `Modularizable` iff their template arguments are.

\cgalHasModel `CGAL::Lazy_exact_nt<NT>`
\cgalHasModel `CGAL::Sqrt_extension<NT,ROOT>`
\cgalHasModel `CGAL::Polynomial<Coeff>`

\sa `CGAL::Modular_traits<T>`
