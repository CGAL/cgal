The class `Triangulation_ds_vertex_base_3` can be used as the base vertex
for a 3D-triangulation data structure, it is a model of the concept
`TriangulationDSVertexBase_3`.

Note that if the triangulation data structure is used as a parameter of a
geometric triangulation (Section \ref TDS3secdesign and
Chapter \ref chapterTriangulation3 "3D Triangulations"), then the vertex base class has to
fulfill additional geometric requirements, i.e.\ it has to be a model of the
concept `TriangulationVertexBase_3`.

This base class can be used directly or can serve as a base to derive
other base classes with some additional attributes (a color for
example) tuned for a specific application.
