\cgalRefines TriangulationDataStructure_3::Cell

The concept `TriangulationDSCellBase_3` describes the requirements for
the cell base class of a `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_3<Vb,Cb>`.

Note that if the `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_3`
is plugged into a triangulation class,
the face base class may have additional geometric
requirements depending on the triangulation class.

At the base level
(see the Software Design sections of the Chapters \ref Triangulation3secdesign "Triangulation"
and  \ref TDS3secdesign "Triangulation Datastructure"),
a cell stores handles to its four vertices and to its four neighbor cells.
The vertices and neighbors are indexed 0, 1, 2 and 3. Neighbor `i`
lies opposite to vertex `i`.

Since the Triangulation data structure is the class which defines the handle
types, the cell base class has to be somehow parameterized by the Triangulation
data structure. But since it is itself parameterized by the cell and vertex
base classes, there is a cycle in the definition of these classes. In order
to break the cycle, the base classes for vertex and cell which are given as
arguments for the Triangulation data structure use `void` as Triangulation
data structure parameter, and the Triangulation data structure then uses a
<I>rebind</I>-like mechanism (similar to the one specified in
`std::allocator`) in order to put itself as parameter to the vertex and
cell classes. The <I>rebound</I> base classes so obtained are the classes
which are used as base classes for the final vertex and cell classes.
More information can be found in Section \ref TDS3secdesign.
