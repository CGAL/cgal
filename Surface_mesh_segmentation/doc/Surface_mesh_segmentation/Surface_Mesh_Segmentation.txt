\section Surface_mesh_segmentationIntroduction Introduction
Mesh segmentation is the process of decomposing a mesh into smaller and meaningful sub-meshes.
This process is used in applications such as modeling, rigging, texturing, shape-retrieval, deformation ...

This package provides an implementation of the algorithm relying on the <em>Shape Diameter Function</em> \cgalCite{Shapira2008Consistent} (SDF).
Given a triangulated surface mesh (simply <em>mesh</em> in the following) bounding a 3D solid object,
the SDF provides an estimate of the local object diameter for each facet of the mesh (the SDF values).
The segmentation algorithm first applies a soft clustering on the facets using the associated SDF values.
The final segmentation is then obtained via a graph-cut algorithm that considers surface-based features such as dihedral-angle and concavity,
together with the result of the soft clustering.
We refer to a comprehensive survey on mesh segmentation \cgalCite{Shamir2008SegmentationSurvey} for different segmentation techniques.

This package offers the computation of the SDF values and the mesh segmentation result as independent functions.
This allows an alternative implementation of the SDF to be directly plugged into the segmentation algorithm,
and also to reuse the SDF values several times with different parameters for the segmentation algorithm.

\section Surface_mesh_segmentationOverviewoftheSegmentation Overview of the Segmentation Process

\subsection Surface_mesh_segmentationShapeDiameterFunction Shape Diameter Function
The Shape Diameter Function provides a connection between the mesh and the volume of the object it bounds.
More specifically, the SDF is a scalar-valued function defined on facets of the mesh that measures the corresponding local object diameter.
The SDF is used to distinguish between thin and thick parts by adding a local notion of thickness to the facets.
In addition, the SDF is pose-invariant: SDF values remain largely unaffected after changes of pose (see \cgalFigureRef{Segmentation_pose_changes}).

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_segmentationRawSDF Computation of Raw SDF Values
For a given input mesh, the raw SDF values are computed by processing each facet one by one. For a given facet,
several rays are sampled in a cone constructed using the centroid of the facet as apex and inward-normal of the facet as axis.
Each ray in cast into a segment, its endpoints being the apex of the cone and the first mesh facet intersection point.
If a ray forms an obtuse angle with the inward-normal of the first intersected facet, it is not accepted.
Using the lengths of the accepted cast rays, which intuitively correspond to a local volume sampling,
the raw SDF value is calculated by first applying an outlier removal procedure and then taking average of the lengths.
Note that only facets having no accepted rays get no raw SDF values
(the package also accepts input meshes with holes, in such a case rays that can not be cast to a segment are also not accepted).

The raw SDF values can be computed using the function `compute_sdf_values()`, setting `postprocess` to `false`.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_segmentationPostprocessing Post-processing of Raw SDF Values
After having calculated the raw SDF value for each facet, the SDF values used in the segmentation algorithm are
the result of several post-processing steps:

- Facets with no raw SDF values are assigned the average raw SDF value of their edge-adjacent neighbors. If there is still a facet having no SDF value,
the minimum amongst all the SDF values is assigned to it (this step is not done in the implementation from the paper).
The main reason for not assigning 0 to facets with no SDF values is that it can obstruct log-normalization process done at the beginning of `segment_from_sdf_values()`.

- A bilateral smoothing \cgalCite{Tomasi1998Bilateral} is applied.
  This smoothing technique removes the noise while trying to keep fast changes on SDF values unchanged since they are natural candidates for segment boundaries.
  The bilateral smoothing has three parameters that are set by default as follows:
  -\f$ w = \lfloor\sqrt{  |F| / 2000}\rfloor + 1 \f$, the window size (i.e. maximum level for breadth-first neighbor selection), where \f$ F \f$ denotes the set of facets
  -\f$ \sigma_s = w / 2 \f$, the spatial parameter
  -\f$ \sigma_{r_i} = \sqrt{1/|w_i| \sum_{f_j \in w_i}(SDF(f_j) - SDF(f_i))^2} \f$, the range parameter set for each facet \f$ f_i \f$; \f$ w_i \f$ denotes the set of neighboring facets of \f$ f_i \f$ collected using \f$ w \f$ in the facet neighbor breadth-first search

  Large window sizes are more effective on eliminating noise but may over-smooth SDF values along segment boundaries.
  Large range parameters make smoothing closer to Gaussian smoothing and may also lead to over-smoothed SDF values.
- SDF values are linearly normalized between [0,1].

These post-processing steps can be applied on raw SDF values (or any scalar values associated with facets) using the function `postprocess_sdf_values()`.

\subsection Surface_mesh_segmentationSoftClustering Soft Clustering

Given a number \f$ k \f$  of clusters, the soft clustering is a Gaussian mixture model that consists in fitting \f$ k \f$
Gaussian distributions to the histogram of the SDF values of the facets. It is initialized with k-means++ \cgalCite{Arthur2007Kmeans}, and run multiple times with random seeds.
Among these runs, the best result is used for initializing the expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting the Gaussian distributions.

Note that there is no direct relationship between the number of clusters (parameter for soft clustering) and the  final number of segments.
Intuitively, the number of clusters represents the number of levels of a segmentation by clustering facets that have close SDF values
without considering their connectivity.  However, a large number of clusters is likely to result in detailed segmentation of the mesh
with a large number of segments, see \cgalFigureRef{Segmentation_levels}.

\cgalFigureBegin{Segmentation_levels,effect_of_levels.png}
Influence of the number of clusters over the segmentation. The number of clusters are set to 4, 3, and 2 respectively.
\cgalFigureEnd

The output of this procedure is a matrix that contains probability values for each facet to belong to each cluster.
These probability values are used as input by the hard clustering.

\subsection Surface_mesh_segmentationGraphCut Hard clustering

The hard clustering yields the final segmentation of the input mesh and results from minimizing an energy function
combining the aforementioned probability matrix and geometric surface features.

The energy function minimized using alpha-expansion graph cut algorithm \cgalCite{Boykov2001FastApproximate} is defined as follows:

  <table border="0">
  <tr>
	 <td>
		\f$ E(\bar{x}) = \sum\limits_{f \in F} e_1(f, x_f) + \lambda \sum\limits_{ \{f,g\} \in N} e_2(x_f, x_g) \f$

		\f$ e_1(f, x_f) = -log(max(P(f|x_f), \epsilon)) \f$

		\f$ e_2(x_f, x_g) =
		\left \{
		\begin{array}{rl}
			-log(\theta(f,g)/\pi) &\mbox{ $x_f \ne x_g$} \\
			0 &\mbox{ $x_f = x_g$}
		\end{array}
		\right \} \f$
	 </td>
     <td>
where:
  - \f$F\f$ denotes the set of facets,
  - \f$N\f$ denotes the set of pairs of neighboring facets,
  - \f$x_f\f$ denotes the cluster assigned to facet \f$f\f$,
  - \f$P(f|x_p)\f$ denotes the probability of assigning facet \f$f\f$ to cluster \f$x_p\f$,
  - \f$\theta(f,g)\f$ denotes the dihedral angle between neighboring facets \f$f\f$ and \f$g\f$:
	 concave angles and convex angles are weighted by 1 and 0.1 respectively,
  - \f$\epsilon\f$ denotes the minimal probability threshold,
  - \f$\lambda \in [0,1]\f$ denotes a smoothness parameter.
	 </td>
  </tr>
  </table>

The first term of the energy function provides the contribution of the soft clustering probabilities.
The second term of the energy function is a geometric criteria that is larger when two adjacent facets sharing a sharp and concave edge are in the same cluster.
The smoothness parameter makes this geometric criteria more or less prevalent.

Basically, assigning a high value to the smoothness parameter results in a small number of segments (since constructing a segment boundary would be expensive).
In other words, merging facets that are placed under different clusters is less expensive than separating them and creating boundaries.
On the contrary, assigning smaller values to smoothness parameter results in a high number of segments, by getting closer to the result of the soft clustering
(notice that setting \f$ \lambda=0 \f$ provides the result of the soft clustering). See \cgalFigureRef{Segmentation_lambdas} for the effect of different smoothness parameters.

The hard clustering assigns a cluster id to each facet (see \cgalFigureRef{Cluster_vs_segment} (a)).
A segment consists in a set of connected facets in the same cluster (see \cgalFigureRef{Cluster_vs_segment} (b)).
By default the function `segment_from_sdf_values()` assigns to each facet the id of its segment.
It assigns to each facet the id of its cluster when set `extract_segments` is set to `false`.

\section Surface_mesh_segmentationAPI User Interface
This package provides four functions:
	- `compute_sdf_values()` : computes the SDF value of each facet of an input mesh either in raw or post-processed form.
           SDF values are associated to facets using a property map (see \ref Chapter_CGAL_and_Boost_Property_Maps
"CGAL and Boost Property Maps").
	- `postprocess_sdf_values()` : post-processes raw SDF values. The post-processing is decoupled from
             the function `compute_sdf_values()` to allow the post-processing to be applied on an alternative
             method to compute SDF values or to use an additional post-processing step for example.
	- `segment_from_sdf_values()` : computes the mesh segmentation from the SDF values of the facets of an input mesh.
            The input SDF values can be any set of scalar values associated with each facet as long as they have been normalized between 0 and 1.
            This function allows to use the same SDF values several times but with different parameters for the segmentation stage.
            The segment or cluster ids are associated to the facets using a property map.
	- `compute_sdf_values_and_segment()` : combines the functions above in one line.

These functions expects as input a triangulated surface mesh bounding a 3D solid object.
It should have the following properties:
- combinatorially 2-manifold
- the vertices of the facets are oriented counterclockwise when seen from outside of the object.
- intersection-free
- boundary free.

Note that the current implementation executes fine on meshes that do not match
some of these properties, but may produce unreliable or meaningless segmentations.

The current implementation of the computation of the SDF values relies on the \ref PkgAABB_treeSummary package.
This operation is reliable when the `AABBTraits` model provided has exact predicates.
`::CGAL::Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel` is recommended as geometric traits for this algorithm.

\cgalExample{Surface_mesh_segmentation/compute_sdf_values_example.cpp}

\subsection Example_2 Example: Segmentation from SDF Values
\cgalExample{Surface_mesh_segmentation/segment_from_sdf_values_example.cpp}

\subsubsection Example_3 Computation of SDF Values and Segmentation
The function `compute_sdf_values_and_segment()` combines the two aforementioned functions.
Note that when computing several segmentation of a mesh with different parameters (i.e. number of levels, and smoothing lambda),
it is advised to first compute the SDF values using `compute_sdf_values()` and use them in several calls of the function `segment_from_sdf_values()`.

\cgalExample{Surface_mesh_segmentation/compute_sdf_values_and_segment_example.cpp}

\subsection Surface_mesh_segmentationUsingapolyhedron Using a Polyhedron with an ID per Facet
The previous examples use a `std::map` as property maps for storing the SDF values and the segmentation results. This example uses
a polyhedron type with a facet type storing an extra ID field, together with a vector, as underlying data structure in the property maps.
The main advantage is to decrease from log to constant the complexity for accessing the data associated to facets.

\cgalFigureEnd

We generate a set of sample points in a unit circle and place it tangent to the cone, with it supporting plane orthogonal to the cone direction. Then we combine each point with the apex of the cone to construct the rays.
The sampling method is biased toward the center \cite Vogel1979Sampling in order to make the sampling uniform to the angle.
As a result, we do not use the weighting scheme from the original algorithm in order to reduce the contributions of rays with larger angles.
A comparison with biased and uniform sampling of points can be seen in \cgalFigureRef{Segmentation_vogel}. The final SDF value of a facet is then calculated by averaging the ray lengths falling into 1.5 Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) from the median of all lengths.
