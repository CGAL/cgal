The concept `MeshComplexWithFeatures_3InTriangulation_3` describes a data structure
to represent and maintain a 3D complex embedded in a 3D triangulation.
The concept `MeshComplexWithFeatures_3InTriangulation_3` refines the minimal concept
`MeshComplex_3InTriangulation_3`, designed to represent
3D complexes having only faces with dimension 2 and 3.
Therefore, the concept `MeshComplexWithFeatures_3InTriangulation_3` may represent embedded complexes
including <I>features</I>, i.e.\ faces with dimension \f$ 0\f$ and \f$ 1\f$.

The data structure includes a 3D triangulation which is itself a 3D complex.
To distinguish the faces of the embedded 3D complex from the
faces of the triangulation,
we call
respectively <I>subdomains</I>,
<I>surface patches</I>
<I>curves</I> and <I>corners</I> the faces
of the complex with respective dimensions \f$ 3\f$, \f$ 2\f$, \f$ 1\f$ and \f$ 0\f$.
The triangulations faces are called respectively
cells, facets, edges and vertices.

Each subdomain of the embedded 3D complex is a union of
triangulation cells.
Likewise, each surface patch is a union of
triangulation facets and each curve is a union of triangulation edges.
The corners form a subset of the triangulation vertices.
Note that subdomains, and surface patches are not
necessarily connected. Likewise each corner may be related to several
mesh vertices.
Triangulation facets that belong to some
surface patch are called surface facets.

The concept `MeshComplexWithFeatures_3InTriangulation_3` allows us to mark and retrieve the
cells of the triangulation belonging to the subdomains,
the facets of the triangulation belonging to surface patches,
the edges belonging to curves and the vertices that are corners of the embedded complex.

Within the mesh generation functions,
the concept `MeshComplexWithFeatures_3InTriangulation_3` is the concept describing
the data structure used to maintain the current approximation of the input domain.
At the end of the meshing process, the data structure encodes the resulting mesh.
In particular, each subdomain (resp. surface patch) of the input domain
is then approximated by a subdomain (resp. a surface patch) of the embedded complex
while the curves and corners represent the \f$ 1\f$ and \f$ 0\f$-dimensional features
of the input complex.
