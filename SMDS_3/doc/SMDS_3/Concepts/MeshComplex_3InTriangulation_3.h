The concept `MeshComplex_3InTriangulation_3` describes a data structure
to represent and maintain a 3D complex embedded in a 3D triangulation.
More precisely, the concept `MeshComplex_3InTriangulation_3` is a minimal version
designed to represent
3D complexes that have only faces with dimension \f$ 2\f$ and \f$ 3\f$.
Embedded 3D complexes with faces of dimension \f$ 0\f$, \f$ 1\f$, \f$ 2\f$ and \f$ 3\f$,
are more conveniently represented by the refined concept
`MeshComplexWithFeatures_3InTriangulation_3`.

The data structure includes a 3D triangulation which is itself a 3D complex.
To distinguish the faces of the embedded 3D complex from the
faces of the triangulation, we call the faces of the embedded complex
respectively <I>subdomains</I> for 3D faces
and <I>surface patches</I> for 2D faces,
while the triangulations faces are called respectively
cells, facets, edges, and vertices.

Each subdomain of the embedded 3D complex is a union of
triangulation cells. Cells that belong to some subdomain are said to belong
to the embedded complex.
Each surface patch is a union of
triangulation facets. Triangulation facets that belong to some
surface patch are called surface facets.
The concept `MeshComplex_3InTriangulation_3` handles the marking and retrieval of the
cells of the triangulation belonging to the subdomains
and of the facets of the triangulation belonging to the surface patches.
The concept `MeshComplex_3InTriangulation_3` also includes an index type for vertices of the triangulation
and attaches an integer, called the <I>dimension</I> to each vertex.
When used by the meshing algorithm,
the index and the dimension of each vertex are used to store respectively
the lowest dimensional face of the input complex including the vertex
and the dimension of this face.

In the 3D mesh generator, the concept `MeshComplex_3InTriangulation_3` is used
when the domain to be meshed has no feature with dimension \f$ 0\f$ and \f$ 1\f$.
Such a data structure is used internally by the mesh generator to maintain
the current approximation of each subdomain
and each boundary surface patch.
The data structure encodes the final mesh at the end of the meshing process.
