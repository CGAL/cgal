\defgroup PkgBGLTraits Specializations of boost::graph_traits

\ingroup PkgBGLRef

The \bgl defines the class template
<A HREF="https://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/graph_traits.html">`boost::graph_traits`</A>
as a uniform interface to the properties and types of %graph types.

We provide specializations of this class template for several \cgal data structures.

\section BGLLCCGT Specialization for the Linear_cell_complex_for_combinatorial_map Class

\subsection Requirements

<ul>
<li> The item class used by `CGAL::Linear_cell_complex_for_combinatorial_map` must have both 0-attributes and 2-attributes enabled.</li>

<li> No dart is 1-free, nor 2-free. Holes in a mesh are represented by using the same convention than for `CGAL::Polyhedron_3` and `CGAL::Surface_mesh`: a dart <code>d</code> belongs to a border if the 2-attribute of <code>beta<2>(d)</code> is nullptr.</li>

<li> All darts of the linear cell complexes must be associated with a 2-attribute, except darts that represent holes.</li>

<li> In order to use property maps, darts and types associated with of 0- and 2-attributes must define the two fonctions:
\code
int id() const; // Returns the index.
int& id();      // Returns a reference to the index stored in the attribute.
\endcode
</ul>

For darts, this can be done by defining `Darts_with_id` as `CGAL::Tag_true` in the `Dart_wrapper` struct of the item class. <br>
For attributes, it is possible to use `CGAL::Cell_attribute_with_id` and `CGAL::Cell_attribute_with_point_and_id` classes to define your item class using attributes with id.

You can also use the `CGAL::Linear_cell_complex_bgl_min_items` item class, or you can use directly the `CGAL::Linear_cell_complex_for_bgl_combinatorial_map_helper` class.

\section BGLT2GT Specializations for the 2D Triangulation Classes

Defined in `<CGAL/boost/graph/graph_traits_Triangulation_2.h>`,
`<CGAL/boost/graph/graph_traits_Delaunay_triangulation_2.h>`,
`<CGAL/boost/graph/graph_traits_Regular_triangulation_2.h>`,
`<CGAL/boost/graph/graph_traits_Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_2.h>`,
`<CGAL/boost/graph/graph_traits_Constrained_triangulation_2.h>`,
`<CGAL/boost/graph/graph_traits_Constrained_triangulation_plus_2.h>`, and
`<CGAL/boost/graph/graph_traits_Triangulation_hierarchy_2.h>`.

We provide partial specialization for the classes
`CGAL::Triangulation_2`, `CGAL::Delaunay_triangulation_2`,
`CGAL::Regular_triangulation_2`, `CGAL::Constrained_triangulation_2`,
`CGAL::Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_2`, `CGAL::Constrained_triangulation_plus_2`,
and `CGAL::Triangulation_hierarchy_2`
so that they are model of the graph concepts
`BidirectionalGraph`, `VertexAndEdgeListGraph`, and `FaceListGraph`.

Only finite simplices exist when viewed through the scope of these graph traits classes.
The infinite vertex, halfedges, edges, and faces will thus not appear when looping around a border
vertex, or walking through the faces container.

The mapping between vertices, edges, and faces of the triangulation and the
graph is rather straightforward, but there are some subtleties. The
value type of the \bgl iterators is the vertex or edge descriptor,
whereas in \cgal all iterators and circulators are also handles and
hence have as value type Vertex or Edge.

| `vertex_descriptor`      | `unspecified_type` | Identify vertices in the graph. |
| `halfedge_descriptor`    | `unspecified_type` | Identify halfedges in the graph. It is constructible from and convertible to `Triangulation::Edge`. It is not a simple typedef, but a proper class, because there is no representation for halfedges in the 2D triangulation data structure. |
| `edge_descriptor`        | `unspecified_type` | Identify edges in the graph. It is constructible from and convertible to `Triangulation::Edge`. It is not a simple typedef, but a proper class, because in an undirected graph the edges `(u,v)` and `(v,u)` must be equal. This is not the case for the Edge type of the triangulation. |

| `vertices_size_type`     | `Triangulation::size_type` | The size type of the vertex list. |
| `edges_size_type`        | `Triangulation::size_type` | The size type of the edge list. |
| `degree_size_type`       | `Triangulation::size_type` | The size type of the adjacency list. |

Defined in `<CGAL/boost/graph/graph_traits_Arrangement_2.h>`
