Many geometric data structures can be interpreted as graphs as they consist of
vertices and edges. This is the case for the halfedge data structure,
for the polyhedral surface, for the arrangement, and for the 2D triangulation classes. With means of
duality one can also interpret faces as vertices and edges between adjacent
faces as edges of the dual graph.

The scope of \cgal is geometry and not graph algorithms. Nevertheless, this package
provides the necessary classes and functions that enable using the
algorithms of the <A HREF="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/index.html">Boost Graph Library</A> \cgalCite{cgal:sll-bgl-02} 
(\sc{Bgl} for short) with \cgal data structures.

Furthermore, this package extends the \sc{Bgl}
by introducing concepts such as `HalfedgeGraph` and `FaceGraph`
allowing to handle *halfedges* and *faces*.
These concepts reflect the design of the halfedge data structure described 
in Chapter \ref PkgHDSSummary, with opposite halfedges, and the circular 
sequence of halfedges around vertices and around faces.

This chapter is organized as follows. Section \ref BGLA  present
the ideas of \sc{Bgl} in a nutshell. Section \ref BGLHeader explains
where to find header files and the chosen naming conventions, as we blend two
different libraries. The four  following sections give examples for
how the surface mesh, the polyhedron, the arrangement, and the 2D triangulation classes
are adapted to \sc{Bgl}. Finally, Section \ref BGLExtensions introduces
the `HalfedgeGraph` which is an extension to the graph concepts of the \sc{Bgl}.

\section BGLA A Short Introduction to the Boost Graph Library

The algorithms of \sc{Bgl} operate on models of the various <I>graph concepts</I>. 
The <I>traits class</I> `boost::graph_traits` enable the algorithms determining the types of vertices and edges
(similar to `std::iterator_traits` for iterators).
<I>Free functions</I> that operate on graphs enable the algorithms to obtain,
for example, the source vertex of an edge, or all edges incident to a vertex. The algorithms 
use <I>property maps</I> to associate information with vertices and edges. 
The algorithms enable <I>visitors</I> to register callbacks that are called
later on during the execution of the algorithms. Finally, the graph algorithms use
the <I>named parameter</I> mechanism, which enambles passing the arguments in
arbitrary order.


\subsection BGLGraphConcepts Graph Concepts

\sc{Bgl} introduces several <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/graph_concepts.html">graph concepts</a>,
which have different sets of characteristics and requirements.
For example iterating through all vertices or all edges in a graph, obtaining the outgoing 
edges of a vertex, or also the in-going edges, inserting vertices and edges into a graph, and removing vertices and edges from a graph.

\subsection BGLTheGraphTraitsClass The Graph Traits Class

An algorithm operating on a graph model determines types with the help of the traits class
<a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/graph_traits.html">boost::graph_traits</a>.  
Such types are the `vertex_descriptor`,
which is similar to a vertex handle in \cgal data structures, 
the `edge_descriptor` which is similar to the halfedge handle in
the halfedge data structure and to the type `Edge` in 2D triangulations.
There are also iterators, such as the `vertex_iterator`, which is similar 
to a vertex iterator in \cgal data structures, and the `out_edge_iterator`, 
which is similar to the edge circulator; it enables to iterate through the edges
incident to a vertex. The iterators are similar and not equivalent,
because their value type is a `vertex_descriptor`, whereas in
\cgal handles, iterators, and circulators all have the same value
type, namely the vertex or edge type.  Given a graph type `G` the
definition of a vertex descriptor looks as follows:

\code {.cpp}
boost::graph_traits<Graph>::vertex_descriptor vd;
\endcode

\subsection BGLFreeFunctionsforExploringaGraph Free Functions for Exploring a Graph

The algorithms obtain incidence information with the help of global
functions such as:
- `std::pair<vertex_iterator,vertex_iterator> vertices(const Graph& g);` for obtaining an iterator range providing access to all the vertices, or 
- `int num_vertices(const Graph&);` for obtaining the number of vertices of a graph, or
- `vertex_descriptor source(edge_descriptor, const Graph&);` for
obtaining the source vertex of an edge. 

Note, that the way we have written the types is a simplification, that is in reality
the signature of the first of the above functions is 

\code{.cpp}
typedef boost::graph_traits<Graph>::vertex_iterator vertex_iterator;
std::pair<vertex_iterator,vertex_iterator> vertices(const Graph& g);
\endcode


\subsection BGLPropertyMaps Property Maps

Another feature extensively used in \sc{Bgl} is the *property map*,
which is offered by the <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/property_map/doc/property_map.html">Boost Property Map Library</a>. Property maps
are a general purpose interface for mapping key objects to
corresponding value objects. 

\sc{Bgl} uses property maps to associate information with vertices and edges.
This mechanism uses a traits class (`boost::property_traits`) and free
functions for obtaining (`get`) and writing (`put`) information in vertices,
edges, and also halfedges and faces for models of the \cgal graph concepts. 
For example, \sc{Bgl}
Dijksta's shortest path algorithm writes the predecessor of each vertex, as
well as the distance to the source  in such a property map.
 
Some default property maps are associated with the graph types. They
are called *internal property maps* and can be retrieved using an
overload of the function `get()`. For example, pm = get(boost::vertex_index, g)
returns a property map that associates an index
in the range `[0, num_vertices(g))` with each vertex of the graph.
This reduces the number of parameters to pass. 
The data itself may be stored in the vertex or the edge, or it may
be stored in an external data structure, or it may be computed on
the fly. This is an implementation detail of a particular property map.

See also the Chapter \ref PkgProperty_mapSummary.

\subsection BGLVisitors Visitors

Visitors are objects that provide functions that are called at
specified event points by the algorithm they visit. 

The functions as well as the event points are algorithm specific. Examples of event points in graph algorithms are when a vertex is traversed the first time, or when all outgoing edges of a vertex are traversed.<BR>

See also Section <A HREF="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/visitor_concepts.html">Visitor Concepts</A>
in the \sc{Bgl} manual.

\subsection BGLNamedParameters Named Parameters

The algorithms of \sc{Bgl} often have many parameters with default
values that are appropriate for most cases. In general, when no
special treatment is applied, the values of such parameters are passed
as a sequence. Deviating from the default for a certain parameter
requires the user to explicitly pass values for all preceding
parameters. The solution to this problem
is to first write a tag and then the parameter, which for
Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm might look as follows:

\code {.cpp}
std::vector<vertex_descriptor> p(num_vertices(g));
std::vector<int> d(num_vertices(g));
vertex_descriptor s = vertex(A, g);
dijkstra_shortest_paths(g, s, predecessor_map(&p[0]).distance_map(&d[0]));
\endcode

In the \sc{Bgl} manual this is called 
<a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/bgl_named_params.html">named parameters</a>.
The named parameters in the example use the tags `predecessor_map` and `distance_map` 
and they are concatenated with the dot operator.<BR>




\section BGLHeader Header Files, Namespaces, and Naming Conventions

Partial specializations of the `boost::graph_traits<Graph>` for the \cgal package `PACKAGE` are in the
namespace `boost` and in the header file `CGAL/boost/graph/graph_traits_PACKAGE.h`.   The
free functions are in the namespace `CGAL`, as the compiler uses argument dependent lookup to find them.
The %Euler operations are in the namespace `CGAL::Euler`, as the function `remove_face()` is at
the same time a low level and an %Euler operation.
Concerning the naming conventions we have to use those of \sc{Bgl}, as we have to fulfill the requirements of the concepts defined in \sc{Bgl}.

\section BGLSurface_mesh The Class Surface_mesh as Model of the Boost Graph Concept

The class `Surface_mesh` is a model of most of \sc{Bgl} graph
concepts as well as the concepts provided by \cgal. A full list can
be found in the documentation of `boost::graph_traits`. The examples show how to use some of
the \sc{Bgl} algorithms with `Surface_mesh` and show how to use
the concepts provided by \cgal to implement a simple algorithm.

\subsection BGLExampleMinimumSpanningTreeofaSurfaceMesh Example: Minimum Spanning Tree of a Surface_mesh

The following example program computes the minimum spanning tree on a surface mesh.
More examples can be found in the chapters
\ref PkgSurfaceMeshSimplificationSummary, \ref PkgSurfaceSegmentationSummary, and \ref PkgSurfaceMeshDeformationSummary.

The surface mesh class uses integer indices to address vertices and edges,
and it comes with a built-in property mechanism that maps nicely on the \sc{Bgl}.

\cgalExample{BGL_surface_mesh/prim.cpp}



\section BGLPolyhedral The Class Polyhedron_3 as Model of the Boost Graph Concept

The class `Polyhedron_3` is a model of most of \sc{Bgl} graph
concepts as well as the concepts provided by \cgal. A full list can
be found in the documentation of `boost::graph_traits`. The examples show how to use some of
the \sc{Bgl} algorithms with `Polyhedron_3` and show how to use
the concepts provided by \cgal to implement a simple algorithm.

\subsection BGLExampleMinimumSpanningTreeofaPolyhedral Example: Minimum Spanning Tree of a Polyhedral Surface

The following example program computes the minimum spanning tree on a polyhedral surface.
More examples can be found in the Chapter
\ref PkgSurfaceMeshSimplificationSummary.

\cgalExample{BGL_polyhedron_3/kruskal.cpp}

\subsection BGLExampleUsingVerticesandEdgeswithanID Example: Using Vertices, and Edges with an ID

The following example program shows a call to the \sc{Bgl} 
Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm accessing the `id()` 
field stored in a polyhedron vertex.

The main function illustrates the access to the `id()` field.

\cgalExample{BGL_polyhedron_3/kruskal_with_stored_id.cpp}


\section BGLTriangulations Triangulations as Models of the Boost Graph Concept

Triangulations have vertices and faces. An edge is a pair of a face handle and the
index of the edge.
Particular care has to be taken with the infinite vertex and its incident
edges. One can either use a `boost::filtered_graph` in order to make the infinite edges
invisible, or one can have a property map that returns an infinite length
for these edges.

A classical example for an algorithm that is a combination of
computational geometry and graph theory is the <I>Euclidean Minimum
Spanning Tree</I> for a point set in the plane. It can be computed by
running the minimum spanning tree algorithm on a Delaunay
triangulation of the point set.

\subsection BGLExampleEuclideanMinimumSpanningTree Example: Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree

In the following example we create a Delaunay triangulation and run Kruskal's minimum
spanning tree algorithm on it. Because the vertex handles of the triangulation are not indices
in an array, we have to provide a property map that maps vertex handles to
integers in the range `[0, t.number_of_vertices())`.

\cgalExample{BGL_triangulation_2/emst.cpp}

\subsection BGLExampleStoringtheVertexIDintheVertex Example: Storing the Vertex ID in the Vertex

The algorithms of \sc{Bgl} extensively use of the indices of
vertices. In the previous example we stored the indices in a `std::map`
and turned that map in a property map. This property map was then
passed as argument to the shortest path function.

If the user does not pass explicitly a property map, the graph algorithms
use the property map returned by the call `get(boost::vertex_index,ft)`.
This property map assumes that the vertex has a 
member function `id()` that returns a reference to an int.
Therefore \cgal offers a class `Triangulation_vertex_base_with_id_2`.
It is in the users responsibility to set the indices properly.

The example further illustrates that the graph traits also works
for the Delaunay triangulation.

\cgalExample{BGL_triangulation_2/dijkstra_with_internal_properties.cpp}

\section BGLArrangements Arrangements as Models of the Boost Graph Concept

\cgal offers the graph traits for the arrangement
itself as well as for its dual graph.

\subsection arr_sssecbgl_primal Example for the Arrangement as Graph 

Arrangement instances are adapted to <I>boost</I> graphs by specializing the
`boost:graph_traits` template for `Arrangement_2` instances. The
graph-traits states the graph concepts that the arrangement class models
(see below) and defines the types required by these concepts.

In this specialization the `Arrangement_2` vertices correspond to the
graph vertices, where two vertices are adjacent if there is at least one
halfedge connecting them. More precisely, `Arrangement_2::Vertex_handle`
is the graph-vertex type, while `Arrangement_2::Halfedge_handle` is the
graph-edge type. As halfedges are directed, we consider the graph to be
directed as well. Moreover, as several interior-disjoint \f$ x\f$-monotone curves
(say circular arcs) may share two common endpoints, inducing an arrangement
with two vertices that are connected with several edges, we allow parallel
edges in our <I>boost</I> graph.

Given an `Arrangement_2` instance, we can efficiently traverse its
vertices and halfedges. Thus, the arrangement graph is a model of the concepts
`VertexListGraph` and `EdgeListGraph` introduced by \sc{Bgl}.
At the same time, we use an iterator adapter of the circulator over the
halfedges incident to a vertex (`Halfedge_around_target_circulator` - see
Section \ref arr_sssectr_vertex "Traversal Methods for an Arrangement Vertex" 
of the chaper on arrangements), so it is possible to go over the ingoing
and outgoing edges of a vertex in linear time. Thus, our arrangement graph
is a model of the concept `BidirectionalGraph` (this concept refines
`IncidenceGraph`, which requires only the traversal of outgoing edges).

It is important to notice that the vertex descriptors we use are
`Vertex_handle` objects and <I>not</I> vertex indices. However, in order
to gain more efficiency in most \sc{Bgl} algorithm, it is better to have them
indexed \f$ 0, 1, \ldots, (n-1)\f$, where \f$ n\f$ is the number of vertices. We
therefore introduce the `Arr_vertex_index_map<Arrangement>` class-template,
which maintains a mapping of vertex handles to indices, as required by
\sc{Bgl}. An instance of this class must be attached to a valid arrangement
vertex when it is created. It uses the notification mechanism (see
Section \ref arr_secnotif) to automatically maintain the mapping of vertices
to indices, even when new vertices are inserted into the arrangement or
existing vertices are removed.

In most algorithm provided by \sc{Bgl}, the output is given by
<I>property maps</I>, such that each map entry corresponds to a vertex.
For example, when we compute the shortest paths from a given source vertex
\f$ s\f$ to all other vertices we can obtain a map of distances and a map of
predecessors - namely for each \f$ v\f$ vertex we have its distance from \f$ s\f$
and a descriptor of the vertex that precedes \f$ v\f$ in the shortest path from \f$ s\f$.
If the vertex descriptors are simply indices, one can use vectors to
efficiently represent the property maps. As this is not the case with the
arrangement graph, we offer the `Arr_vertex_property_map<Arrangement,Type>`
template allows for an efficient mapping of `Vertex_handle` objects to
properties of type `Type`. Note however that unlike the
`Arr_vertex_index_map` class, the vertex property-map class is not
kept synchronized with the number of vertices in the arrangement, so it
should not be reused in calls to \sc{Bgl} functions in case the arrangement
is modified in between these calls.

\cgalFigureBegin{figex_bgl,ex_bgl.png}
An arrangement of 7 line segments, as constructed by `ex_bgl_primal_adapter.cpp` and `ex_bgl_dual_adapter.cpp`. The breadth-first visit times for the arrangement faces, starting from the unbounded face \f$ f_0\f$, are shown in brackets.
\cgalFigureEnd

In the following example we construct an arrangement of 7 line segments,
as shown in \cgalFigureRef{figex_bgl},
then use \sc{Bgl} Dijkstra's shortest-paths algorithm to compute
the graph distance of all vertices from the leftmost vertex in the
arrangement \f$ v_0\f$. Note the usage of the `Arr_vertex_index_map` and
the `Arr_vertex_property_map` classes. The latter one, instantiated by
the type `double` is used to map vertices to their distances from \f$ v_0\f$.

\cgalExample{BGL_arrangement_2/primal.cpp}

\subsection arr_sssecbgl_dual Example for the Dual of an Arrangement as Graph 

It is possible to give a dual graph representation for an arrangement instance,
such that each arrangement face corresponds to a graph vertex and two vertices
are adjacent iff the corresponding faces share a common edge on their
boundaries. This is done by specializing the
`boost:graph_traits` template for `Dual<Arrangement_2>` instances,
where `Dual<Arrangement_2>` is a template specialization that gives a
dual interpretation to an arrangement instance.

In dual representation, `Arrangement_2::Face_handle`
is the graph-vertex type, while `Arrangement_2::Halfedge_handle` is the
graph-edge type. We treat the graph edges as directed, such that a halfedge
`e` is directed from \f$ f_1\f$, which is its incident face, to \f$ f_2\f$, which
is the incident face of its twin halfedge. As two arrangement faces may
share more than a single edge on their boundary, we allow parallel
edges in our <I>boost</I> graph. As is the case in the primal graph, the dual
arrangement graph is also a model of the concepts `VertexListGraph`,
`EdgeListGraph` and `BidirectionalGraph` (thus also of 
`IncidenceGraph`).

Since we use `Face_handle` objects as the vertex descriptors, we define
the `Arr_face_index_map<Arrangement>` class-template, which maintains an
efficient mapping of face handles to indices. We also provide the template
`Arr_face_property_map<Arrangement,Type>` for associating arbitrary
data with the arrangement faces.

In the following example we construct the same arrangement as in
example `ex_bgl_primal_adapter.cpp` (see \cgalFigureRef{arr_figex_bgl}),
and perform breadth-first search on the graph faces, starting from the
unbounded face. We extend the \sc{Dcel} faces
with an unsigned integer, marking the discover time of the face and use a
breadth-first-search visitor to obtain these times and update the faces
accordingly:

\cgalExample{BGL_arrangement_2/arrangement_dual.cpp}

\section BGLExtensions Extensions of the BGL

The previous sections introduced partial specializations 
and free functions so that several \cgal data structures are adapted as models of some 
of the \sc{Bgl} graph concepts.
In this section we define a set of new concepts to extend the
functionality of \sc{Bgl} in order to match \ref PkgHDSSummary  more
closely and to enable writing generic algorithms, which operate on data structures that 
have faces and halfedges.


`HalfedgeGraph` refines
<a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/BidirectionalGraph.html">`Bidirectional Graph`</a> with operations to accommodate halfedge data structures. 
Given a halfedge, say `h`, the concept `HalfedgeGraph` requires the provision 
of the halfedge opposite to `h`, the halfedge that succeeds `h`,
and the halfedge that precedes `h`.


`MutableHalfedgeGraph` adds the requirement for operations to
change the next/previous relation and to adjust the target of a halfedge.

`FaceGraph` adds the requirements to explicitly handle faces in
a graph, to provide quick access to incident halfedges of a face, and to
enable access from every halfedge to an adjacent face. `FaceListGraph`
adds the requirement for efficient traversal of
faces. `MutableFaceGraph` adds requirements to change adjacency of
faces and halfedges, and to remove and add faces.

The halfedge extensions are used by the surface simplification algorithms,
which follow the design of \sc{Bgl} as sketched in Section \ref BGLA.



\subsection BGLIteratorsAndCirculators Iterators and Circulators

Starting at a halfedge `h` of a halfedge graph `g`, applying several times `next(h,g)` brings us back 
to the halfedge where we started. All halfedges traversed on the way are incident to the same face.

Using the composition of the `next(h,g)` and `opposite(h,g)` functions results 
in another cycle, namely the cycle of halfedges which are incident to
the same vertex.

For convenience, two iterator and circulator types enable the traversal of all halfedges
incident to a given face, and all halfedges having a given vertex as target.

These types  are not part of the concept `HalfedgeGraph`, but they 
are class templates that work for any model of this concept.

\subsection BGLEulerOperations Euler Operations

There are two categories of mutating operations. The first category comprises 
low level operations that change incidences such as the target vertex of a 
halfedge. 
A halfedge graph might turn invalid by the application of inconsistent 
low lever operations.   The second category of operations
are called <em>%Euler Operations</em>. These are high level operations such
as adding a center vertex to a face, which means also adding halfedges
and faces, and updating incidence information. The %Euler operations 
enable manipulating models of `MutableFaceGraph`.


\subsection BGLDual The Dual Graph

The <em>dual graph</em> of a `FaceGraph` `G` is a graph that has a vertex for each
face of `G`. The dual graph has an edge whenever two faces of `G` are
separated from each other by an edge. Thus, each edge `e` of `G` has a
corresponding dual edge, the edge that connects the two faces on
either side of `e`.

The class template `Dual` is an adaptor that creates the dual view of
a `FaceGraph`. Faces of the original graph correspond to vertices in
the `Dual` and vice versa.

The dual graph comes in handy when one wants to compute the connected
component of a surface mesh.

Note that border edges in a `Dual` have the `null_face` of the
original graph as either source or target. This is unusual and might
break other algorithms since edges are always assumed to have non-null
vertices as a source and target. It is possible to filter border edges
using `boost::filtered_graph` as shown in the following example.

\cgalExample{BGL_surface_mesh/surface_mesh_dual.cpp}


\subsection BGLExampleIncidentVertices Example: Finding Incident Vertices in a HalfedgeGraph

The following example shows several functions that enable navigating in a `HalfedgeGraph`.
We have two implementations of the operation that finds the vertices adjacent to a vertex `v`.
Let us have a look at the first version. Given a vertex descriptor `vd`, 
we first call `halfedge(vd,g)` to obtain the halfedge with `vd` as target. 
Applying `source()` then gives us an adjacent vertex. We then get to the next halfedge 
with `vd` as target, by first going to the next halfedge around the face, and then 
going to the opposite halfedge.

The second version does the `%next()` and `%opposite()` jumping with an iterator.
Note that when calling `source()` we have to dereference `hi`, as the function 
expects a halfedge descriptor and not a halfedge iterator.
Also note that `halfedges_around_target()` expects a halfedge, and not a vertex.
This provides the user with the ability to start the traversal at a specific 
halfedge incident to the input vertex (and not the arbitrary incident halfedge 
stored in the vertex record.)

\cgalExample{BGL_polyhedron_3/incident_vertices.cpp}

\subsection BGLExampleNormalHalfedgeGraph Example: Calculating Facet Normals using HalfedgeGraph

The following example program shows a simple algorithm for calculating
facet normals for a polyhedron using the \sc{Bgl} API. A
<a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/property_map/doc/vector_property_map.html">boost::vector_property_map</a>
is used to to store the calculated normals instead of changing the Polyhedron items class.

\cgalExample{BGL_polyhedron_3/normals.cpp}
