  The function `box_intersection_all_pairs_d()` computes the pairwise intersecting boxes
  between two sequences of iso-oriented boxes in arbitrary dimension.
  It does so by comparing all possible pairs of boxes and is thus
  inferior to the fast `box_intersection_d()` algorithm.

  The sequences of boxes are given with two forward iterator ranges. The
  sequences are not modified. For each intersecting pair of boxes a
  `callback` function object is called with the two intersecting
  boxes as argument; the first argument is a box from the first
  sequence, the second argument a box from the second sequence.

  The algorithm is interface compatible with the
  `box_intersection_d()` function. Similarly, we call the
  `value_type` of the iterators the <I>box handle</I>, which is
  either our box type or a pointer type to our box type.

  A \f$ d\f$-dimensional iso-oriented box is defined as the
  %Cartesian product of \f$ d\f$ intervals. We call the
  box <I>half-open</I> if the \f$ d\f$ intervals \f$ \{ [lo_i,hi_i) \,|\, 0 \leq
  i < d\}\f$ are half-open intervals, and we call the box <I>closed</I> if
  the \f$ d\f$ intervals \f$ \{ [lo_i,hi_i] \,|\, 0 \leq i < d\}\f$ are closed
  intervals. Note that closed boxes support zero-width boxes and they
  can intersect at their boundaries, while non-empty half-open boxes
  always have a positive volume and they only intersect iff their
  interiors overlap. The distinction between closed or half-open boxes
  does not require a different representation of boxes, just a different
  interpretation when comparing boxes, which is selected with the
  `topology` parameter and its two values,
  `Box_intersection_d::HALF_OPEN` and
  `Box_intersection_d::CLOSED`.

  In addition, a box has a unique `id`-number. Boxes with equal
  `id`-number are not reported since they obviously intersect trivially.

  The algorithm uses a traits class of the `BoxIntersectionTraits_d`
  concept to access the boxes. A default traits class is provided that
  assumes that the box type is a model of the `BoxIntersectionBox_d`
  concept and that the box handle, i.e., the iterators value type, is
  identical to the box type or a pointer to the box type.

  An important special application of this algorithm is the test for
  self-intersections where the second box sequence is an identical copy
  of the first sequence including the preserved `id`-number. We
  offer a specialized implementation `box_self_intersection_all_pairs_d()`
  for this application.

  \addtogroup  PkgBoxIntersectionD_box_intersection_d

  The function `box_intersection_d()` computes the pairwise intersecting boxes
  between two sequences of iso-oriented boxes in arbitrary dimension.
  The sequences of boxes are given with two random-access iterator
  ranges and will be reordered in the course of the algorithm. For each
  intersecting pair of boxes a `callback` function object is called
  with the two intersecting boxes as argument; the first argument is a
  box from the first sequence, the second argument a box from the second
  sequence. The performance of the algorithm can be tuned with a
  `cutoff` parameter, see the implementation section below for more
  details.

  The algorithm reorders the boxes in the course of the algorithm. Now,
  depending on the size of a box it can be faster to copy the boxes, or
  to work with pointers to boxes and copy only pointers. We offer
  automatic support for both options. To simplify the description, let
  us call the `value_type` of the iterators <I>box handle</I>. The
  <I>box handle</I> can either be our box type itself or a pointer (or
  const pointer) to the box type.

  A \f$ d\f$-dimensional iso-oriented box is defined as the
  %Cartesian product of \f$ d\f$ intervals. We call the
  box <I>half-open</I> if the \f$ d\f$ intervals \f$ \{ [lo_i,hi_i) \,|\, 0 \leq
  i < d\}\f$ are half-open intervals, and we call the box <I>closed</I> if
  the \f$ d\f$ intervals \f$ \{ [lo_i,hi_i] \,|\, 0 \leq i < d\}\f$ are closed
  intervals. Note that closed boxes support zero-width boxes and they
  can intersect at their boundaries, while non-empty half-open boxes
  always have a positive volume and they only intersect iff their
  interiors overlap. The distinction between closed or half-open boxes
  does not require a different representation of boxes, just a different
  interpretation when comparing boxes, which is selected with the
  `topology` parameter and its two values,
  `Box_intersection_d::HALF_OPEN` and
  `Box_intersection_d::CLOSED`.

  In addition, a box has a unique `id`-number. It is used to order
  boxes consistently in each dimension even if boxes have identical
  coordinates. In consequence, the algorithm guarantees that a pair of
  intersecting boxes is reported only once. Boxes with equal
  `id`-number are not reported since they obviously intersect trivially.

  The algorithm uses a traits class of the `BoxIntersectionTraits_d`
  concept to access the boxes. A default traits class is provided that
  assumes that the box type is a model of the `BoxIntersectionBox_d`
  concept and that the box handle, i.e., the iterators value type, is
  identical to the box type or a pointer to the box type.

  An important special application of this algorithm is the test for
  self-intersections where the second box sequence is an identical copy
  of the first sequence including the preserved `id`-number. Note
  that this implies that the address of the box is not sufficient for
  the `id`-number if boxes are copied by value. To ease the use of
  this special case we offer a simplified version of this function with
  one iterator range only, which then creates internally the second copy
  of the boxes, under the name `box_self_intersection_d()`.

  In the general case, we distinguish between the bipartite case (the
  boxes are from different sequences) and the complete case (the boxes
  are from the same sequence, i.e., the self intersection case). The
  default is the bipartite case, since the complete case is typically
  handled with the simplified function call mentioned above. However,
  the general function call offers the `setting` parameter with the
  values `Box_intersection_d::COMPLETE` and
  `Box_intersection_d::BIPARTITE`.

  \warning The two sequences of boxes passed to `box_intersection_d()` can be
  ranges created from the same container, but these ranges must not contain
  any common element.

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

  The implemented algorithm is described in \cgalCite{cgal:ze-fsbi-02} as
  version two. Its performance depends on a `cutoff` parameter.
  When the size of both iterator ranges drops below the `cutoff`
  parameter the function switches from the streamed segment-tree
  algorithm to the two-way-scan algorithm, see \cgalCite{cgal:ze-fsbi-02}
  for the details.

  The streamed segment-tree algorithm needs \f$ O(n \log^d (n) + k)\f$
  worst-case running time and \f$ O(n)\f$ space, where \f$ n\f$ is the number of
  boxes in both input sequences, \f$ d\f$ the (constant) dimension of the
  boxes, and \f$ k\f$ the output complexity, i.e., the number of pairwise
  intersections of the boxes. The two-way-scan algorithm needs \f$ O(n \log
  (n) + l)\f$ worst-case running time and \f$ O(n)\f$ space, where \f$ l\f$ is the
  number of pairwise overlapping intervals in one dimensions (the
  dimension where the algorithm is used instead of the segment tree).
  Note that \f$ l\f$ is not necessarily related to \f$ k\f$ and using the
  two-way-scan algorithm is a heuristic.

  Unfortunately, we have no general method to automatically determine an
  optimal cutoff parameter, since it depends on the used hardware, the
  runtime ratio between callback runtime and segment-tree runtime, and
  of course the number of boxes to be checked and their distribution. In
  cases where the callback runtime is dominant, it may be best to make
  the threshold parameter small. Otherwise a `cutoff`\f$ =\sqrt{n}\f$ can
  lead to acceptable results. For well distributed boxes the original
  paper \cgalCite{cgal:ze-fsbi-02} gives optimal cutoffs in the thousands.
  Anyway, for optimal runtime some experiments to compare different
  cutoff parameters are recommended. See also
  Section \ref secboxintersperformance .

\cgalHeading{Concurrency}

  The first template parameter of the function enables to choose whether
  the algorithm is to be run in parallel, if `CGAL::Parallel_tag` is specified
  and \cgal has been linked with the Intel TBB library, or sequentially,
  if `CGAL::Sequential_tag` - the default value - is specified.
  The parallelization of the algorithm is based on a divide-and-conquer
  approach: the two ranges are split in a number of smaller ranges, and
  all combinations of subranges are treated in parallel. It is thus
  recommended to use ranges of pointers to bounding boxes, to keep
  these copies light.

  \warning The parallel mode comes with a small overhead due to the
  duplication and splitting of the input ranges. It is an improvement
  for almost all inputs, but not all. A configuration where the two ranges
  are small and entirely disjoint might result in a slightly worse
  runtime when using the parallel version. Users should benchmark both
  versions to verify that their data does not fall in this (small)
  set of inputs.

  \warning When using the parallel mode, the callback function must
  be threadsafe.

\cgalHeading{Example}

  The box implementation provided with
  `Box_intersection_d::Box_d<double,2>` has a special
  constructor for the \cgal bounding box type `Bbox_2` (and
  similar for dimension 3). We use this in the example to create \f$ 3
  \times 3\f$ `boxes` in a grid layout. Additionally we pick the
  center box and the box in the upper-right corner as our second box
  sequence `query`.

  The default policy of the box type implements the `id`-number with
  an explicit counter in the boxes, which is the default choice since it
  always works. We use the `id`-number in our callback function to
  report the result of the intersection algorithm call. The result will
  be that the first `query` box intersects all nine `boxes` and
  the second `query` box intersects the four boxes in the
  upper-right quadrant.
