\section intro Understanding the Polyhedron demo

These pages are not documenting the whole Polyhedron demo but only the API that can be useful to create and add a new plugin.

There are several levels in this demo. 

- The MainWindow, which contains the UI elements. 

- Among these elements is the Viewer, which is the drawable surface that handles all the drawing and all the keyboard and mouse events. 

- The Viewer has a reference to the Scene, which contains the Scene_item list, which is a list of the drawn elements. 

A plugin usually defines an object that inherits from Scene_item or uses some of them to demonstrate a CGAL feature, so it might have to deal with the above elements.

\section examplePlugin Creating a simple Plugin
\subsection examplePluginItself The plugin itself
A basic plugin will inherit from Polyhedron_demo_plugin_interface. It can also inherits from the Polyhedron_demo_plugin_helper instead, for a more detailed model of plugin.
It must be created in a folder named Xxxx_yyyy_plugin containing all the files created for it, and a CMakeLists.txt file. This file contains the following line :
Its name must be of the form Polyhedron_demo_xxxx_yyyy_plugin. \n
<b>In the CMakeList.txt file, in the section Plugins, add the following lines :</b>

    include( polyhedron_demo_macros )
    #if the plugin has a UI file
    qt5_wrap_ui( xxxx_yyyyUI_FILES Polyhedron_demo_xxxx_yyyy_plugin.ui)
    polyhedron_demo_plugin(xxx_yyyy_plugin Polyhedron_demo_xxx_yyyy_plugin ${xxx_yyyyUI_FILES})
    #if the plugin uses external libraries like scene_items
    target_link_libraries(xxx_yyyy_plugin scene_polygon_xxxx_yyyy_item scene_xxxx_zzzz_item)
    
And in the main CMakeLists.txt, you must add the following line:

    add_subdirectory(Xxxx_yyyy_plugin)

  [init]: @ref CGAL::Three::Polyhedron_demo_plugin_helper#init(QMainWindow *, Scene_interface *)
  The class must contain the following lines :\n

    Q_OBJECT\n
    Q_INTERFACES(Polyhedron_demo_plugin_interface)\n
    Q_PLUGIN_METADATA(IID "com.geometryfactory.PolyhedronDemo.PluginInterface/1.0")\n

In the function [init], get a reference to the Scene  and to the MainWindow. Then, create and link the actions of the plugin.\n
Create a list of QActions containing the actions of the plugin.\n
Add the following line:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
    actionName->setProperty("submenuName", "Name_you_want_for_your_submenu");
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
to place your action in a submenu in the Operation Menu.\n
If the plugin implements a new Scene_item, please notice that a Scene_item has a number of functions that will need a reference to the Viewer through the Viewer_interface type.

A plugin must always contain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include "Polyhedron_demo_xxxx_yyyy_plugin.moc"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection examplePluginDialog Adding a dialog

This section describes how to add a dialog on the use of an action.

For a minimalist dialog, intended to get a single parameter for instancem you can create a QInputDialog :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
    const unsigned int parameter =
      QInputDialog::getInt((QWidget*)mw,
                           tr("Title"), // dialog title
                           tr("Parameter's value:"), // field label
                           10, // default value = fast
                           0, // min
                           100, // max
                           1, // step
                           &ok);
    if(!ok) return;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

For a more elaborate interface, you will have to use the designer tool of QtCreator. Create a new Qt Designer form (file->New file or Project->Qt->), and select among the template/form choices. 
Name it Polyhedron_demo_your_plugin_name_plugin_dialog.ui (you may have to rename it once it is created as QtCreator tends to forget the capital letters), and add it to the project in the CMakeList :

    qt5_wrap_ui( exampleUI_FILES Polyhedron_demo_example_plugin.ui )
    polyhedron_demo_plugin(example_plugin Polyhedron_demo_example_plugin ${exampleUI_FILES})
    target_link_libraries(example_plugin scene_polyhedron_item)

Edit the ui file with the editor, then add the following line to your plugin file:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include "ui_Polyhedron_demo_your_plugin_name_plugin.h"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can then add a new class inheriting from QDialog and your own dialog, accessible with "Ui::". Add the macro Q_OBJECT and the line 
    setupUi(this) 
in your constructor. You can populate the dialog in the action, using dialog.show() or dialog.exec().

\subsection examplePluginDockWidget Adding a dock widget
This section describes how to add a Dock Widget to the application.
Just like with the Dialog, create a new Qt Designer form (file->New file or Project->Qt->Qt Designer Form), choose QDockWidget in Widgets, and add it to the project in the CMakeList :
    qt5_wrap_ui( exampleUI_FILES dock_example.ui )
    polyhedron_demo_plugin(example_plugin Polyhedron_demo_example_plugin ${exampleUI_FILES})
    target_link_libraries(example_plugin scene_polyhedron_item)
Edit the ui file with the editor, then add the following line to your plugin file:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
    #include "ui_dock_example.h"
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Add a DockQWidget* and a Ui::your_dock_widget as private members of your plugin :
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
    private:
    Ui::Dock_example ui_widget;
    QDockWidget* dock_widget;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
and initialize them in the init fucntion :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
  dock_widget = new QDockWidget("Mesh Deformation", mw);
      dock_widget->setVisible(false); // do not show at the beginning

      ui_widget.setupUi(dock_widget);
      mw->addDockWidget(Qt::LeftDockWidgetArea, dock_widget);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use signal/slots to connect the dock widget to the plugin, and connect them in the init() function, and use the functions show()/hide() to make your 
dock widget visible or not. By default, a dock widget will remain visible next time the demo is launched if it has not been closed. If you want to avoid that behavior, override the
function closure() in you plugin, and simply call hide on your dock widget in it.

\subsection exampleUsingAGroupItem Using a Scene_group_item
This section will explain how to use a group item in a plugin. 
A group item is a virtual item that is not seen in the viewer, nor drawn, but act as a parent for a list of actual items. Its main goal lays within the 
interaction with the sceneView (which is the list of items on the left of the viewer). With group items, this view becomes hierarchic, which allows to interract with several objects at the same time, and organize this view.

To use a group item in your plugin, you will need a CGAL::Three::Scene_group_item, of course, and a CGAL::Three::Scene_interface. As a group item will automatically contain all the selected items of the scene when it is created, 
the first thing to do is to clear the selection with CGAL::Three::Scene_interface::setSelectedItem(-1). Then you can create a new Scene_group_item and give the items you want to regroup to it with CGAL::Three::Scene_interface::changeGroup().
Once it is done, add the group to the scene with CGAL::Three::Scene_interface::add_group(). 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
    //clears the selection to avoid adding unwanted items to the group.
    scene->setSelectedItem(-1);
    //Creates a new group
    Scene_group_item *group = new Scene_group_item("New group");
    //Then gives it its children
    for(int i =0; i<3; i++)
    scene->changeGroup(items[i], group);
    //adds it to the scene
    scene->add_group(group);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\section exampleexternalPlugin Creating an external plugin

To create an external plugin, you must make a new Cmake project.
In the CMakeLists you must fetch the exported targets of the polyhedron demo (polyhedron_demo_macros.cmake).
An external plugin will not be automatically loaded in the Polyhedron demo. It must be built in its own project.

\section example Example : 
\subsection example1 Creating a simple plugin
The following code will create a plugin that adds an action to the MainWindow. This action is called "Draw Triangle" and adds a triangle to the scene.
\cgalExample{Three/Example_plugin/Polyhedron_demo_example_plugin.cpp}

\subsection example2 Creating an external plugin
The following code makes the same thing than the previous, only the plugin is external.

    project( Example_plugin )
    # Find includes in corresponding build directories
    set(CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR ON)
    # Instruct CMake to run moc automatically when needed.
    set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.11)
    if(POLICY CMP0043)
      cmake_policy(SET CMP0043 OLD)
    endif()

    # Compatibility with CMake 3.0
    if(POLICY CMP0042)
      # Do not enable the use of MACOSX_RPATH
      # http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/policy/CMP0042.html
      cmake_policy(SET CMP0042 OLD)
    endif()
    #Find CGAL
    find_package(CGAL COMPONENTS Qt5)
    include( ${CGAL_USE_FILE} )
    # Find Qt5 itself
    find_package(Qt5
                 QUIET
                 COMPONENTS            OpenGL Script Svg Xml
                 OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS   ScriptTools)

    if(Qt5_FOUND AND CGAL_FOUND)
      find_package(CGAL_polyhedron_demo
      HINTS "${CGAL_DIR}" "${CGAL_DIR}/Polyhedron/demo/Polyhedron-build"
      )

    include( ${CGAL_POLYHEDRON_DEMO_USE_FILE} )
    # Let plugins be compiled in the same directory as the executable.
    set(CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}")


      #include( ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../Polyhedron/demo/Polyhedron/polyhedron_demo_macros.cmake )
      qt5_wrap_ui( exampleUI_FILES Polyhedron_demo_example_plugin.ui dock_example.ui)
      qt5_wrap_ui( example_dockUI_FILES dock_example.ui)
      polyhedron_demo_plugin(example_plugin Polyhedron_demo_example_plugin ${exampleUI_FILES} ${example_dockUI_FILES})
      target_link_libraries(example_plugin scene_polyhedron_item)
    endif()
