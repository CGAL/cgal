\ingroup PkgSnapRounding2Ref

The class `Snap_rounding_traits_2<Kernel>` is a model of the
`SnapRoundingTraits_2` concept, and is the only traits class supplied
with the package.
This class should be instantiated with an exact geometric kernel that conforms
to the \cgal kernel-concept, such as the
`Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel`, or `Cartesian<Gmpq>`.

This geometric kernel must provide an (arbitrary-precision) rational number type
(`FT`), `Point_2`, `Segment_2` and `Iso_rectangle_2`.
It should be possible to cast numbers of the number type `FT` to
double-precision representation. That is, the function
`CGAL::to_double(FT)` must be supported.

The `CGAL::to_double()` function is used to implement the operation that
rounds the coordinates of a point to a center of a pixel. This operation is one
of the traits-concept requirement. The coordinates are converted to double,
rounded down to the nearest grid point, and finally adjusted to lie on a center
of a pixel. Notice that if
`CGAL::to_double()` returns the closet value, then when it rounds up a given
coordinate, the resulting ISR, may be imprecise, and the distance between some
vertex and a non-incident edge can be slightly less than the guaranteed
half-the width-of-a-pixel.
