\section{Analysis}

Function \ccc{CGAL::compute_average_spacing()} computes the average spacing of all input points to their $k$ nearest neighbor points, $k$ being specified by the user. As it provides an order of a point set density, this function is used downstream the surface reconstruction pipeline to automatically determine some parameters such as output mesh sizing for surface reconstruction. \\

\ccExample

The following example reads a point set in the \ccc{xyz} format and computes the average spacing. Index, position and color are stored in a tuple and accessed through property maps.

Note that other functions such as centroid or bounding volumes are found in other \cgal\ components: \\
\ccc{CGAL::centroid}  \\
\ccc{CGAL::bounding_box}  \\
\ccc{Min_sphere_of_spheres_d<Traits>}  \\
