\defgroup psp_namedparameters Named Parameters for Point Set Processing
\ingroup PkgPointSetProcessingRef

In this package, all functions optional parameters are implemented as BGL optional named parameters (see \ref BGLNamedParameters for more information on how to use them).

Since the parameters of the various point set processing functions defined in this
package are redundant, their long descriptions are centralized below. 

In the following, we assume that the following types are provided as template parameters of point set processing functions and classes. Note that, for some of these functions, the type is more specific.

<ul>
<li>`PointRange` is a model of `Range`. The value type of its iterator is the key type of the related property maps (see below).</li>
<li>`GeomTraits` a geometric traits class in which constructions are performed and predicates evaluated. Everywhere in this package, a \cgal `Kernel` fulfills the requirements.</li>
</ul>

`CGAL::parameters::all_default()` can be used to indicate
that default values of optional named parameters must be used.

Here is the list of the named parameters available in this package:

 is the solver used for diagonalizing covariance matrices.\n
\b Type: a class model of `DiagonalizeTraits`.\n
\b Default: `CGAL::Eigen_diagonalize_traits` if \ref thirdpartyEigen "Eigen" 3.2 (or greater) is available and `CGAL_EIGEN3_ENABLED` is defined.\n
\cgalNPEnd

\cgalNPBegin{svd_traits} \anchor PSP_svd_traits
 is the linear algebra algorithm required by the jet fitting method. For more information, please refer to the documentation of `CGAL::Monge_via_jet_fitting`.\n

\cgalNPEnd

\cgalNPBegin{callback} \anchor PSP_callback
is a mechanism to get feedback on the advancement of the algorithm while it's running and to interrupt it if needed. It is called regularly when the algorithm is running: the current advancement (between 0. and 1.) is passed as parameter. If it returns `true`, then the algorithm continues its execution normally; if it returns `false`, the algorithm is stopped.\n
The callback will be copied and therefore needs to be lightweight.\n
Note that when a callback is run on a parallelized algorithm with `CGAL::Parallel_tag`, it is called asynchronously on a separate thread and shouldn't access or modify the variables that are parameters of the algorithm.\n
\b Type: `CGAL::cpp11::function<bool(double)>`.\n
