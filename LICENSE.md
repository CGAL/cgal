License of CGAL files in the Git repository
===========================================
The first vector of diffusion of the CGAL sources is the publication of the
source tarballs of CGAL releases, twice a year. The file
[`Installation/LICENSE`](Installation/LICENSE), in the Git repository, is the file `LICENSE` at the
root of the source tarballs. It describes the license of all the files of
the source tarballs.

A lot of files in the Git repository are not distributed in the source
tarballs, for examples all the files in the `doc/` and `test/`
sub-directories of CGAL packages. For all those files, unless they have an
explicit license notice, the license is the Creative Commons CC0 1.0. The text can be found 
at https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ .
