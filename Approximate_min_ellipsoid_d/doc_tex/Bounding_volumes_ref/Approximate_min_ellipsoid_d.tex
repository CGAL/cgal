\ccDefinition

An object of class \ccRefName\ is an approximation to the
ellipsoid of smallest volume enclosing a finite multiset of points
in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space~$\E^d$, $d\ge 2$.

An \emph{ellipsoid} in $\E^d$ is a Cartesian pointset of the form $\{
x\in\E^d \mid x^T E x + x^T e + \eta\leq 0 \}$, where $E$ is some
positive definite matrix from the set $\R^{d\times d}$, $e$ is some
real $d$-vector, and $\eta\in\R$.  A pointset $P\subseteq \E^d$ is
called \emph{full-dimensional} if its affine hull has dimension $d$.
For a finite, full-dimensional pointset $P$ we denote by $\mel(P)$ the
smallest ellipsoid that contains all points of $P$; this ellipsoid
exists and is unique.

%% i.e.~$me(P)=\emptyset$ if
%% $P=\emptyset$, $me(P)=\{p\}$ if
%% $P=\{p\}$, and $me(P) = \{ (1-\lambda)p + \lambda q
%% \mid 0 \leq \lambda \leq 1 \}$ if
%% $P=\{p,q\}$.

For a given finite and full-dimensional pointset $P\subset \E^d$ and a
real number $\epsilon\ge 0$, we say that an ellipsoid ${\cal
E}\subset\E^d$ is an \emph{$(1+\epsilon)$-appoximation} to $\mel(P)$ if
$P\subset {\cal E}$ and $\vol({\cal E}) \leq (1+\epsilon)
\vol(\mel(P))$.  In other words, an $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to
$\mel(P)$ is an enclosing ellipsoid whose volume is by at most a
factor of $1+\epsilon$ larger than the volume of the smallest
enclosing ellipsoid of $P$.

Given this notation, an object of class \ccRefName\ represents an
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to $\mel(P)$ for a given finite and
full-dimensional multiset of points $P\subset\E^d$ and a real constant
$\epsilon>0$.\footnote{A \emph{multiset} is a set where elements may
have multiplicity greater than~$1$.} When an
\ccc{Approximate_min_ellipsoid_d<Traits>} object is constructed, an
iterator over the points $P$ and the number $\epsilon$ have to be
specified; the number $\epsilon$ defines the \emph{desired
approximation ratio} $1+\epsilon$.  The underlying algorithm will then
try to compute an $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to $\mel(P)$, and one of
the following two cases takes place.
\begin{itemize}
\item The algorithm determines that $P$ is not full-dimensional (see
  \ccc{is_full_dimensional()} below).

  \emph{Important note:} due to rounding errors, the algorithm cannot
  in all cases decide correctly whether $P$ is full-dimensional or
  not.  If \ccc{is_full_dimensional()} returns \ccc{false}, the points
  lie in such a ``thin'' subspace of $\E^d$ that the algorithm is
  incapable of computing an approximation to $\mel(P)$.  More
  precisely, if \ccc{is_full_dimensional()} returns \ccc{false}, there
  exist two parallel hyperplanes in $\E^d$ with the points $P$ in
  between so that the distance $\delta$ between the hyperplanes is
  very small, possible zero. (If $\delta=0$ then $P$ is not
  full-dimensional.)

  If $P$ is not full-dimensional, linear algebra techniques should be
  used to determine an affine subspace $S$ of $\E^d$ that contains the
  points $P$ as a (w.r.t.\ $S$) full-dimensional pointset; once $S$ is
  determined, the algorithm can be invoked again to compute an
  approximation to (the lower-dimensional) $\mel(P)$ in $S$.  Since
  \ccc{is_full_dimensional()} might (due to rounding errors, see
  above) return \ccc{false} even though $P$ is full-dimensional, the
  lower-dimensional subspace $S$ containing $P$ need not exist.
  Therefore, it might be more advisable to fit a hyperplane $H$
  through the pointset $P$, project $P$ onto this affine subspace $H$,
  and compute an approximation to the minimum-volume enclosing
  ellipsoid of the projected points within $H$; the fitting can be
  done for instance using the \ccc{linear_least_squares_fitting()}
  function from the \cgal\ package \ccc{Principal_component_analysis}.
\item The algorithm determines that $P$ is full-dimensional.  In this
  case, it provides an approximation ${\cal E}$ to $\mel(P)$, but
  depending on the input problem (i.e., on the pair $(P,\epsilon)$),
  it may not have achieved the desired approximation ratio but merely
  some \emph{worse} approximation ratio $1+\epsilon'>1+\epsilon$.  The
  achieved approximation ratio $1+\epsilon'$ can be queried using
  \ccc{achieved_epsilon()}, which returns $\epsilon'$. The ellipsoid
  ${\cal E}$ itself can be queried via the methods
  \ccc{defining_matrix()}, \ccc{defining_vector()}, and
  \ccc{defining_scalar()}.
\end{itemize}

The ellipsoid ${\cal E}$ computed by the algorithm satisfies the inclusions
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:approximate_min_ellipsoid_incl}
\frac{1}{(1+\epsilon')d} {\cal E} \subseteq \mathop{\rm
conv}\nolimits(P) \subseteq {\cal E}
\end{equation}
where $f {\cal E}$ denotes the ellipsoid ${\cal E}$ scaled by the
factor $f\in\R^+$ with respect to its center, and where $\mathop{\rm
conv}\nolimits(A)$ denotes the \emph{convex hull} of a pointset
$A\subset \E^d$.

The underlying algorithm can cope with all kinds of inputs (multisets
$P$, $\epsilon\in[0,\infty)$) and terminates in all cases.  There
is, however, no guarantee that any desired approximation ratio
is actually achieved; the performance of the algorithm in this respect
highly depends on the input pointset.  Values of at least $0.01$ for
$\epsilon$ are usually handled without problems.

Internally, the algorithm represents the input points' Cartesian
coordinates as \ccc{double}'s.  For this conversion to work, the input
point coordinates must be convertible to \ccc{double}.  Also, in order
to compute the achieved epsilon $\epsilon'$ mentioned above, the algorithm
requires a number type \ccc{ET} that provides \emph{exact} arithmetic.
(Both these aspects are discussed in the documentation of the concept
\ccc{ApproximateMinEllipsoid_d_Traits_d}.)
