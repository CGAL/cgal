Kinetic Surface Reconstruction

This CGAL package reconstructs a piece-wise planar 3D surface from a point cloud.
Planar shapes, detected in the input point cloud, partition the bounding box of the input data via Kinetic Shape Partition.
The reconstruction is formulated as an energy minimization trading data faithfulness for simplicity which labels the cells in the partition and solved by graph-cut.
