% cprog.tex (or cprog.sty) - formatting of C programs

% This allows C programs to be formatted directly by TeX.  It can be
% invoked by \cprogfile{filename} or (in LaTeX) \begin{cprog} ...
% \end{cprog} or (in plain TeX) \cprog ... \end{cprog}.  In LaTeX, the
% alternative form \begin{cprog*} is allowed, where spaces in C strings
% are printed using the `square u' character (like LaTeX {verbatim*}).
% In plain TeX, you have to use \csname cprog*\endcsname for this (sorry).
% If you are using \cprogfile, say \cprogttspacetrue beforehand if you
% want this effect.

% The formatting is (necessarily) simple.  C text is set in a normal Roman
% font, comments in a slanted font, and strings in a typewriter font, with
% spaces made visible as the `square u' symbol.  Tabs are expanded to four
% spaces (this does not look good when comments are aligned to the right of
% program text).  Some pairs of input characters appear as single output
% characters: << <= >> >= != -> are respectively TeX's \ll \le \gg \ge \ne
% \rightarrow.

% The fonts below can be changed to alter the setting of the various parts
% of the program.  The \cprogbaselineskip parameter can be altered to
% change the line spacing.  LaTeX's \baselinestretch is taken into account
% too.  The indentation applied to the whole program is \cprogindent,
% initially 0.  Before and after the program there are skips of
% \beforecprogskip and \aftercprogskip; the default values are \parskip
% and 0 respectively (since there will often be a \parskip after the
% program anyway).

% This package works by making a large number of characters active.  Since
% even spaces are active, it is possible to examine the next character in
% a macro by making it a parameter, rather than using \futurelet as one
% would normally do.  This is more convenient, but the coding does mean
% that if the next character itself wants to examine a character it may
% look at a token from the macro rather than the input text.  I think that
% all cases that occur in practice have been looked after.

% The macros were thrown together rather quickly, and could do with some
% work.  For example, the big macro defined with @[] taking the place of
% \{} could be recoded to use \{} and so be more legible.  The grouping of
% two-character pairs should be controllable, since not everyone will want
% it.  The internal macros etc should have @ in their names, and should be
% checked against LaTeX macros for clashes.

% Allow multiple inclusion to go faster.
