x clean up Compute_naive_Frechet_distance_3.cpp
x move Frechet_naive into internal directory and adapt everything for it to compile
x create small set of 3d test curves
x create small set of 100d test curves
x create 3d queries
- add them to the test suite
- run tests

x copy Compute_naive_Frechet_distance_3.cpp to Compute_naive_Frechet_distance_100.cpp
- then do the same as for 3d tests

- also use compute distance in the tests if it wasn't done yet
