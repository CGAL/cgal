This package provides functions for computing the Fréchet distance of polylines in any dimension under the Euclidean metric.

\section secFrechetDistanceIntroduction Introdution

The Fréchet distance is a classical dissimilarity measure between polylines.
Its advantages over other measures is that it both considers the polylines as continuous objects and takes into account the ordering of the points.
Intuitively, the Fréchet distance is commonly explained as follows: Imagine a human walking on one polyline while a dog walks on the other polyline, they are connected by a leash, and they are only allowed to walk forward. The Fréchet distance is the shortest leash length that allows the human and the dog to jointly walk from start to end on their respective trajectories.

The Fréchet distance is a metric. This implies that two polylines have distance zero if and only if they are equal (after removing redundant vertices).

\section secFrechetDistanceAPI API

The package provides one function to approximate the Fréchet distance and one function to decide whether the Fréchet distance is at most a given value.

The function `approximate_Frechet_distance()` computes an approximation of the Fréchet distance between two polylines, up to a given approximation error. It returns an interval that contains the true distance.
The function `is_Frechet_distance_larger()` decides if the Fréchet distance
between two polylines is larger than a given bound.

Both functions have as template parameter a traits class defining the dimension and the point type.
The traits classes have as template parameter a kernel. This may be a kernel such as `Simple_cartesian`
with a floating point number type, or a filtered kernel such as `Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel`.
In both cases the result is guaranteed to be correct.


\section secFrechetDistanceImplementation Implementation

Internally all computations are done using interval arithmetic. In case of filter failures
the algorithm switches to the usage of square root extensions.

The algorithms in this package are an adaption of the implementation of a <a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.17">SoCG</a>/<a href="https://doi.org/10.20382/jocg.v12i1a4">JoCG</a> paper. In particular, the implementation can decide non-difficult cases very fast while for difficult cases it still has the quadratic running time guarantee of the classical Fréchet distance algorithm by Alt and Godau. This is achieved by using fast filtering methods and a divide and conquer algorithm with pruning rules on the free-space diagram.


\section secFrechetDistanceExamples Examples

In the examples we use different kernels to illustrate that the functions
work as well for inexact or exact kernels.

\subsection subsecFrechetDistanceImplementation  Implementation History

An initial version using floating point arithmetic was developed by the authors
while working at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbrücken, Germany.
André Nusser, together with Sebastien Loriot and Andreas Fabri, introduced
the usage of interval arithmetic and square root extensions to alleviate issues stemming from rounding errors and hence ensuring correctness of the computation.
