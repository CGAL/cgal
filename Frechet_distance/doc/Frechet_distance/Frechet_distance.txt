This package provides functions for computing the Fréchet distance of polylines in any dimension under the Euclidean metric.

\section secFrechetDistanceIntroduction Introdution

The Fréchet distance is a classical dissimilarity measure between polylines.
Its advantages over other measures is that it both considers the polylines as continuous objects and takes into account the ordering of the points.
Intuitively, the Fréchet distance is commonly explained as follows: Imagine a human walking on one polyline while a dog walks on the other polyline,
they are connected by a leash, and they are only allowed to walk forward. The Fréchet distance is the shortest leash length that allows the human
and the dog to jointly walk from start to end on their respective trajectories.

The Fréchet distance is a metric. This implies that two polylines have distance zero if and only if they are equal (after removing redundant vertices).

\section secFrechetDistanceAPI API

The package provides one function to approximate the Fréchet distance and one function to decide whether the Fréchet distance is at most a given value.

The function `bounded_error_Frechet_distance()` computes an approximation of the Fréchet distance between two polylines, up to a given approximation error.
It returns an interval that contains the true distance.
The function `is_Frechet_distance_larger()` decides if the Fréchet distance
between two polylines is larger than a given bound.

Both functions have as template parameter a traits class defining the dimension and the point type.
The traits classes have as template parameter a kernel, model of the concept `Kernel`.
In case the static constant `Has_filtered_predicates`  of the kernel is `true`, the functions
combine interval arithmetic with a fallback to exact computing in case comparisons of intervals
are uncertain.  This means for `Simple_cartesian<double>` that there are no guarantees, for
`Simple_cartesian<Exact_rational>` that all computation is done with exact rationals,
and for kernels such as `Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel`,  `Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel`,
`Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel_with_sqrt`,
as well as `Epick_d` and `Epeck_d`, the computation is filtered and hence fast and at
the same time guaranteed to be correct.


\section secFrechetDistanceImplementation Implementation

The algorithms in this package are an adaption of the implementation of \cgalCite{cgal:bkn-wdfp-19}
and \cgalCite{cgal:bkn-wdfp-21}. In particular, the implementation can decide non-difficult cases very
fast while for difficult cases it still has the quadratic running time guarantee of the classical Fréchet
distance algorithm by Alt and Godau cgalCite{ag-cfdbt-95}. This is achieved by using fast bounding
box filtering methods and a divide and conquer algorithm with pruning rules on the free-space diagram.


\section secFrechetDistanceExamples Examples

In the examples we use different kernels to illustrate that the functions
can be used with either inexact or exact kernels.

\subsection subsecFrechetDistanceFirstExample Decision for 2D Polylines

The following example shows how we can use `is_Frechet_distance_larger()` to decide whether the Fréchet
distance between two polylines in the Euclidean plane is at most a given value.

\cgalExample{Frechet_distance/Frechet_distance_2.cpp}

\subsection subsecFrechetDistanceSecondExample Distance Computation for 3D Polylines

The following example shows how we can compute the Fréchet distance up to a given error bound on two
polylines in 3-dimensional Euclidean space using `bounded_error_Frechet_distance()`.
As we use `Simple_cartesian<double>` the algorithm uses plain floating point arithmetic
without guarantees for correctness.

\cgalExample{Frechet_distance/Frechet_distance_3.cpp}



\subsection subsecFrechetDistanceThirdExample Distance Computation for dD Polylines

The following example shows how we can compute the Fréchet distance up to a given error bound on two
polylines in 4-dimensional Euclidean space using `bounded_error_Frechet_distance()`.

\subsection subsecFrechetDistanceImplementation  Implementation History

An initial version using floating point arithmetic was developed by the authors
while working at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbrücken, Germany.
André Nusser, together with Sebastien Loriot and Andreas Fabri, introduced
the usage of interval arithmetic and square root extensions to alleviate issues stemming from rounding errors and hence ensuring correctness of the computation.
