\ccPkgHowToCiteCgal{cgal:sal-pptsm2-11b}
\ccPkgSummary{Parameterizing a surface amounts to finding a one-to-one mapping from
a suitable domain to the surface. In this package, we focus on
triangulated surfaces that are homeomorphic to a disk and on piecewise
linear mappings into a planar domain.  This package implements
some of the state-of-the-art surface mesh parameterization methods,
such as least squares conformal maps, discrete conformal map, discrete
authalic parameterization, Floater mean value coordinates or Tutte
barycentric mapping.}
