\section Surface_mesh_parameterizationIntroduction Introduction

Parameterizing a surface amounts to finding a one-to-one mapping from
a suitable domain to the surface. A good mapping is the one which
minimizes either angle distortions (conformal parameterization) or
area distortions (equiareal parameterization) in some sense. In this
package, we focus on parameterizing triangulated surfaces which are
homeomorphic to a disk or a sphere, and on piecewise linear mappings
onto a planar domain.

Although the main motivation behind the first parameterization methods
was the application to texture mapping, it is now frequently used for
mapping more sophisticated modulation signals (such as normal,
transparency, reflection or light modulation maps), fitting scattered
data, re-parameterizing spline surfaces, repairing CAD models,
approximating surfaces and remeshing.

This \cgal package implements surface parameterization methods, such as
As Rigid As Possible Parameterization, Tutte Barycentric Mapping,
Discrete Authalic Parameterization, Discrete Conformal Maps,
Least Squares Conformal Maps, Floater Mean Value Coordinates, or Orbifold Tutte Embeddings.
These methods mainly distinguish by the distortion they
minimize (angles vs. areas), by the constrained border onto the
planar domain (convex polygon vs. free border) and by the bijectivity guarantees
of the mapping.

The package proposes an interface for any model of the concept `FaceGraph`,
such as the classes `Surface_mesh`, `Polyhedron_3`, `Seam_mesh`, or the mesh
classes of <A HREF="https://www.openmesh.org">OpenMesh</A>.

\remark The class `Seam_mesh` can be used to virtually cut a mesh,
allowing to transform an input mesh in subdomain(s) that fit the
disk-or-sphere topology requirement.

Since parameterizing meshes requires an efficient representation of sparse
matrices and efficient iterative or direct linear solvers, we provide
a unified interface to linear solvers  as described in Chapter
\ref PkgSolverInterface.

Note that linear solvers commonly use double precision floating point
numbers. Therefore, this package is intended to be used with a \cgal %Cartesian kernel with doubles.

\section Surface_mesh_parameterizationBasics Basics

\subsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationDefaultSurface Default Surface Parameterization

From the user point of view, the simplest entry point to this package
is the following function:

\code{.cpp}
template <typename TriangleMesh, typename VertexUVMap>
Error_code parameterize(TriangleMesh & mesh,
                        boost::graph_traits<TriangleMesh>::halfedge_descriptor bhd,
                        VertexUVMap uvm);
\endcode

The function `parameterize()` applies a default surface parameterization
method, namely Floater Mean Value Coordinates \cgalCite{cgal:f-mvc-03} (see Section
\ref Surface_mesh_parameterizationFloaterMean), to the connected component of the
mesh of type `TriangleMesh` with the border given by the halfedge `bhd`.
This border is parameterized with an arc-length circular border parameterization.
The sparse linear solver of the \ref thirdpartyEigen library is used.

The mesh of type `TriangleMesh` must be a model of the concept
`FaceGraph` and must additionally be triangulated, 2-manifold, oriented,
and homeomorphic to a disc (possibly with holes). The last requirement
is not hard and we will later show how to parameterize a mesh that is
not a topological disk (Section \ref secCuttingaMesh).
The result is stored in a property map (whose type is here VertexUVMap)
for the mesh vertices. See also Chapter \ref PkgPropertyMap.

\subsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationDefaultExample Default Parameterization Example
In the following example, we apply the default parameterization (Floater Mean Value
Coordinates) to a `Surface_mesh` mesh. We store the UV-coordinates as a vertex property
using the `Surface_mesh` built-in property mechanism.

\cgalExample{Surface_mesh_parameterization/simple_parameterization.cpp}

Figure \cgalFigureRef{Surface_mesh_parameterizationfigsimple} illustrates the input and output
of this program.

\subsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationEnhancedparameterize Choosing a Parameterization Algorithm

This package provides a second `parameterize()` entry point
where the user can specify a parameterization method:

\code{.cpp}
template <typename TriangleMesh, typename Parameterizer_3, typename VertexUVMap>
Error_code parameterize(TriangleMesh& mesh,
                        Parameterizer_3 parameterizer,
                        boost::graph_traits<TriangleMesh>::halfedge_descriptor bhd,
                        VertexUVMap uvm);
\endcode

It computes a one-to-one mapping from a 3D triangle surface mesh to a simple 2D domain.
The mapping is piecewise linear on the triangle mesh. The result is a pair (u,v)
of parameter coordinates for each vertex of the input mesh.
A one-to-one mapping may be guaranteed or not, depending on the choice of the
Parameterizer_3 algorithm.

In the following example, we use the Discrete Authalic parameterizer with a
circular border parameterization.
We use a `Surface_mesh` for the mesh and store the UV-coordinates as a vertex property
using the `Surface_mesh` built-in property mechanism.

\cgalExample{Surface_mesh_parameterization/discrete_authalic.cpp}

Other parameterization methods can easily be swapped in by simply replacing the lines

\code{.cpp}

#include <CGAL/Surface_mesh_parameterization/Circular_border_parameterizer_3.h>
#include <CGAL/Surface_mesh_parameterization/Discrete_authalic_parameterizer_3.h>

// ...

typedef SMP::Circular_border_arc_length_parameterizer_3<SurfaceMesh>  Border_parameterizer;
typedef SMP::Discrete_authalic_parameterizer_3<SurfaceMesh, Border_parameterizer> Parameterizer;

// ...

\endcode

with other <i>compatible</i> border and domain parameterizers, e.g.

\code{.cpp}

#include <CGAL/Surface_mesh_parameterization/Square_border_parameterizer_3.h>
#include <CGAL/Surface_mesh_parameterization/Barycentric_mapping_parameterizer_3.h>

// ...

typedef SMP::Square_border_uniform_parameterizer_3<SurfaceMesh> Border_parameterizer;
typedef SMP::Barycentric_mapping_parameterizer_3<SurfaceMesh, Border_parameterizer> Parameterizer;

// ...

\endcode

Which border and which domain parameterizers can be combined is explained in the next section.

\section secSurfaceParameterizationMethods Surface Parameterization Methods

This \cgal package implements surface parameterization methods, such
as As Rigid as Possible, Tutte Barycentric, Discrete Authalic Parameterization,
Discrete Conformal Map, Least Squares Conformal Maps, Floater Mean Value Coordinates,
or Orbifold Tutte Embeddings. These methods are provided as models of the
`Parameterizer_3` concept.

The different parameterization methods can be classified into three categories
depending on the type of border parameterization that is required: fixed border,
free border, and borderless.

Illustrations of the different methods are obtained with the same input model,
the <i>hand</i> model, shown in Figure \cgalFigureRef{Surface_mesh_parameterizationfigbase}.
The hand is a topological sphere, and a `Seam_mesh` is used to cut it into
a topological disk. In Figure \cgalFigureRef{Surface_mesh_parameterizationfigbase},
the seam is traced in red and the four cones used for Orbifold Tutte
Parameterization (Section \ref Surface_mesh_parameterizationOrbi) are marked with green dots.

\subsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationFixedBorder Fixed Border Surface Parameterizations

Fixed border surface parameterizations are characterized by having a constrained border
in parameter space: two (u,v) coordinates for each vertex along the border.
Different choices exist for such border parameterization methods, described in Section
\ref secBorderParameterizationsforFixedMethods.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationTutteBarycentric Tutte Barycentric Mapping

`Surface_mesh_parameterization::Barycentric_mapping_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer, SolverTraits>`

The Barycentric Mapping parameterization method has been introduced by
Tutte \cgalCite{t-hdg-63}. In parameter space, each vertex is
placed at the barycenter of its neighbors to achieve the so-called
convex combination condition. This algorithm amounts to solve one
sparse linear system for each set of parameter coordinates, with a
\#vertices x \#vertices sparse and symmetric positive definite matrix
(if the border vertices are eliminated from the linear system).
A coefficient \f$ (i,j)\f$ of the matrix is set to 1 for an edge linking
the vertex \f$ v_i\f$ to the vertex \f$ v_j\f$, to minus the degree of the
vertex \f$ v_i\f$ for a diagonal element, and to 0 for any other matrix
entry. Although a bijective mapping is guaranteed when the border is convex,
this method does not minimize either angle nor area distortion.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationDiscreteAuthalic Discrete Authalic Parameterization

`Surface_mesh_parameterization::Discrete_authalic_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer, SolverTraits>`

The Discrete Authalic parameterization method has been introduced by
Desbrun et al. \cgalCite{cgal:dma-ipsm-02}. It corresponds to
a weak formulation of an area-preserving method, and in essence
locally minimizes the area distortion. A one-to-one mapping is
guaranteed only if the convex combination condition is fulfilled and
the border is convex. This method solves two
\#vertices x \#vertices sparse linear systems. The matrix (the same
for both systems) is asymmetric.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationDiscreteConformal Discrete Conformal Map

`Surface_mesh_parameterization::Discrete_conformal_map_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer, SolverTraits>`

Discrete Conformal Map parameterization has been introduced to the graphics community
by Eck et al. \cgalCite{cgal:eddhls-maam-95}. It attempts to
lower angle deformation by minimizing a discrete version of the
Dirichlet energy as derived by Pinkall and
Polthier \cgalCite{cgal:pp-cdmsc-93}. A one-to-one mapping is guaranteed
only when the two following conditions are fulfilled: the barycentric mapping
condition (each vertex in parameter space is a convex combination of
its neighboring vertices), and the border is convex.
This method solves two \#vertices x \#vertices sparse linear
systems. The matrix (the same for both systems) is sparse and symmetric positive
definite (if the border vertices are eliminated from the linear system
and if the mesh contains no hole), and thus can be efficiently solved using
dedicated linear solvers.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationFloaterMean Floater Mean Value Coordinates

`Surface_mesh_parameterization::Mean_value_coordinates_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer, SolverTraits>`

The Mean Value Coordinates parameterization method has been introduced
by Floater \cgalCite{cgal:f-mvc-03}. Each vertex in parameter space is
optimized to be a convex combination of its neighboring vertices.
This method is in essence an approximation of the Discrete Conformal Map,
with a guaranteed one-to-one mapping when the border is convex. This method
solves two \#vertices x \#vertices sparse linear systems. The matrix (the same
for both systems) is asymmetric.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationIterativeAuthalic Iterative Authalic Parameterization

`Surface_mesh_parameterization::Iterative_authalic_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer, SolverTraits>`

The Iterative Authalic parameterization method has been introduced by
Jain et al. \cgalCite{cgal:j-lrsspp-19}. This parameterization
is a fixed border parameterization and is part of the authalic parameterization family,
meaning that it aims to minimize area distortion between the input surface mesh and the parameterized output.
More precisely, the approach used by this parameterizer is to iteratively redistribute
the \f$ L_2\f$ stretch - as defined by Sander et al. \cgalCite{cgal:ssgh-tmpm-01} - over the mesh.

\cgalFigureAnchor{Surface_mesh_parameterizationfigiterativeauthalic}

\cgalFigureCaptionEnd

Although this is a fixed border parameterization method, it does not guarantee a one-to-one mapping.
However, it will in practice yield valid results with less distortion than other authalic
parameterization methods.

\subsubsection secBorderParameterizationsforFixedMethods Border Parameterizations for Fixed Methods

Parameterization methods for borders are used as traits classes modifying the
behavior of `Parameterizer_3` models. They are also provided as models of the
`Parameterizer_3` concept. Border parameterizations for fixed border surface
parameterizations are a family of methods to define a set of constraints, namely two
\f$ u,v\f$ coordinates for each vertex along the border.

Different choices are offered to the user when choosing border parameterizers
for fixed border methods:
<UL>
<LI>The user can select a border parameterization among
two commonly used methods: uniform or arc-length parameterization.

<I>Usage:</I> Uniform border parameterizations are more stable,
although they yield poor visual results. The arc-length border
parameterization is used by default.

<LI>One convex shape specified by one shape among two standard ones:
a circle or a square.

<I>Usage:</I> The circular border parameterization is used by default as it
corresponds to the simplest convex shape. The square border
parameterization is commonly used for texture mapping.
</UL>

All combinations of uniform/arc-length and circle/square are provided by
the following classes:

<LI>`Surface_mesh_parameterization::Circular_border_uniform_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh>`

</UL>

An illustration of the use of different border parameterizers can be found in the
example \ref Surface_mesh_parameterization/square_border_parameterizer.cpp
"square_border_parameterizer.cpp".

\subsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationFreeBorderSurface Free Border Surface Parameterizations

For free border parameterization methods, the vertices of the border are free to move.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationLeastSquares Least Squares Conformal Maps

`Surface_mesh_parameterization::LSCM_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer, SolverTraits>`

The Least Squares Conformal Maps (LSCM) parameterization method has
been introduced by L&eacute;vy et al. \cgalCite{cgal:lprm-lscm-02}.
It corresponds to a conformal method with a free border (at least two
vertices have to be constrained to obtain a unique solution), which
allows further lowering of the angle distortion. A one-to-one mapping
is not guaranteed by this method. It solves a (2 \f$ \times\f$
\#triangles) \f$ \times\f$ \#vertices sparse linear system in the least squares sense,
which implies solving a symmetric matrix.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationARAP As Rigid As Possible Parameterization

`Surface_mesh_parameterization::ARAP_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer, SolverTraits>`

An as-rigid-as-possible parameterization was introduced by Liu et al. \cgalCite{liu2008local}.
It is a shape-preserving method based on an iterative energy minimization process.
Each step alternates a local optimization technique to find the best local mapping
and a global stitching technique equivalent to the resolution of a linear system
to guarantee that the parameterized mesh is a triangulation.

A generalization of the formulation of the local optimization introduces a scalar
coefficient &lambda; that allows the user to balance angle and shape distortion:
the closer &lambda; is to 0, the more importance is given to the minimization
of angle distortion; inversely, when &lambda; grows,
the parameterizer gives more and more importance to the minimization of shape
distortion.

\subsubsection secBorderParameterizationsforFreeMethods Border Parameterizations for Free Methods

Parameterization methods for borders are used as traits classes modifying
the behavior of `Parameterizer_3` models. They are also provided as models of
the `Parameterizer_3` concept. The border parameterizations associated to
free border surface parameterization methods define only two constraints:
the pinned vertices.

<UL>

<I>Usage:</I> `Surface_mesh_parameterization::Two_vertices_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh>` is the default
free border parameterization, and is the only one available
in the current version of this package.

</UL>

\subsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationBorderless Borderless Surface Parameterizations

Borderless parameterization methods do not require as input a mesh that is homeomorphic
to a disk.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationOrbi Orbifold Tutte Embeddings

`Surface_mesh_parameterization::Orbifold_Tutte_parameterizer_3<SeamMesh, SolverTraits>`

Orbifold-Tutte Planar Embedding was introduced by Aigerman and Lipman \cgalCite{aigerman2015orbifold}
and is a generalization of Tutte’s embedding to other topologies, and in particular
spheres, which we consider here. The orbifold-Tutte embedding bijectively maps
the original surface, that is required to be a topological ball, to a canonical,
topologically equivalent, two-dimensional flat surface called an Euclidean orbifold.
There are 17 Euclidean orbifolds, of which only the 4 sphere orbifolds are currently implemented
in CGAL.

The orbifold-Tutte embedding yields a seamless, globally bijective parameterization that,
similarly to the classic Tutte embedding, only requires solving a sparse linear system
for its computation.

The algorithm requires the user to select a set of vertices of the
input mesh and mark them as <i>cones</i>, which will be the singularities of the unfolding.
Internally, the process requires the use of (virtual) seams between the cones, but the choice
of these seams does not influence the result. The `Seam_mesh` structure
(see also Section \ref secCuttingaMesh) is used for this purpose.

\section secCuttingaMesh Cutting a Mesh

The surface parameterization methods proposed in this package only
deal with meshes which are homeomorphic (topologically equivalent) to
discs. Nevertheless, meshes with arbitrary topology and number of
connected components can be parameterized, provided that the user
specifies a cut graph (a set of edges), which defines the
border of a topological disc. These edges can be passed together with
a mesh via the `Seam_mesh` structure.

\cgalFigureBegin{Surface_mesh_parameterizationfigcut,cut.png}
Cut Graph
\cgalFigureEnd

In the following example, we apply the default parameterization to a
`Polyhedron_3`-based `Seam_mesh`. We store the UV-coordinates as a
halfedge property using a `Unique_hash_map`.

Note that vertices on a seam are duplicated in a `Seam_mesh` structure
and thus the UV-coordinates are here associated to the halfedges of the
underlying (input) mesh.

\section Surface_mesh_parameterizationExtendingthe Implementation History

The main author of the first version of this package was Laurent Saboret,
who worked as an engineer at Inria Sophia-Antipolis under the supervision of
Pierre Alliez and Bruno Lévy. Bruno Lévy added OpenNL support to the package.

For CGAL 4.11, the package has undergone a major rewrite by Andreas Fabri and
Mael Rouxel-Labbé. The As-Rigid-As-Possible parameterization technique was added
and all algorithms are now based on the `FaceGraph` API. The Orbifold Tutte Embedding
parameterization technique was also added with the help of its authors, Noam Aigerman
and Yaron Lipman. Finally, the class `Seam_mesh` was introduced to handle
virtual borders. The class `Seam_mesh` is also a model of a `FaceGraph`,
and replaces a wrapper which had a more complicated API.

Iterative authalic parameterization was added in CGAL 5.2 by Mael Rouxel-Labbé,
based on a prototype developed by Hardik Jain.
