\brief computes a random simple polygon by writing its vertices (oriented
counterclockwise) to `result`. The polygon generated will have a number
of vertices equal to the number of unique points in the first \f$ n\f$ points
generated by `pg`.

Constructs a random simple polygon
from points that are drawn from a specific domain.
Though each simple polygon defined on this set of
points has a non-zero probability of being constructed, some polygons may
have higher probabilities than others. The overall distribution of the
generated polygons is not known since it depends on the generated points.

\cgalHeading{Requirements}

- `Traits` is a model of the concept RandomPolygonTraits_2
- `PointGenerator::value_type` is equivalent to
`Traits::Point_2` and `OutputIterator::value_type`.

The default traits class `Default_traits` is the kernel in which
`Traits::Point_2` is defined.

\sa `CGAL::Random_points_in_square_2<Point_2, Creator>`

\cgalHeading{Preconditions}

- The number of unique points in the first \f$ n\f$ points generated by `pg` is at least `3`.
- The unique points in the first \f$ n\f$ points generated by `pg` do not all lie on the same line.

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

The implementation is based on the method of eliminating self-intersections in
a polygon by using so-called "2-opt" moves. Such a move eliminates an
intersection between two edges by reversing the order of the vertices between
the edges. No more than \f$ O(n^3)\f$ such moves are required to simplify a polygon
defined on \f$ n\f$ points \cgalCite{ls-utstp-82}.
Intersecting edges are detected using a simple sweep through the vertices
and then one intersection is chosen at random to eliminate after each sweep.
The worse-case running time is therefore \f$ O(n^4 \log n)\f$.

\cgalHeading{Example}

The following program displays a random simple polygon with up to 100
vertices, where the vertex coordinates are drawn uniformly from the
unit square centered at the origin.
