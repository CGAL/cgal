\section GeneratorIntroduction Introduction

A variety of generators for geometric objects are provided in \cgal.
They are useful as synthetic test data sets, e.g. for testing
algorithms on degenerate object sets and for performance analysis.

Two kinds of point generators are provided: first, random point
generators and second deterministic point generators. Most random
point generators and a few deterministic point generators are provided
as input iterators. The input iterators model an infinite sequence of
points. The function `CGAL::copy_n()` can be used to copy a
finite sequence. The iterator adaptor
`Counting_iterator` can be used to create finite iterator
ranges.
Other generators are provided as functions that write to output
iterators. Further functions add degeneracies or random perturbations.

In 2D, we provide input iterators to generate random points in a disc
(`Random_points_in_disc_2`), 
in a square (`Random_points_in_square_2`),
on a circle (`Random_points_on_circle_2`), 
on a segment (`Random_points_on_segment`),
in a square (`Random_points_on_square_2`),
and in a triangle (`Random_points_in_triangle_2`).
For generating grid points we provide three functions,
`points_on_segment_2()`,
`points_on_square_grid_2()` that write to output iterators and
an input iterator `Points_on_segment_2`.

For 3D points, input iterators are provided for random points uniformly 
distributed in a sphere (`Random_points_in_sphere_3`), in a triangle (`Random_points_in_triangle_3`),
in a tetrahedron (`Random_points_in_tetrahedron_3`), or cube (`Random_points_in_cube_3`) or on the boundary of a sphere
(`Random_points_on_sphere_3`).
For generating 3D grid points, we provide the function 
`points_on_cube_grid_3()` that writes to
an output iterator.

For higher dimensions, input iterators are provided for random points uniformly 
distributed in a `d`-dimensional cube (`Random_points_in_cube_d`)
or `d`-dimensional ball (`Random_points_in_ball_d`) or on the boundary of a 
sphere (`Random_points_on_sphere_d`).
For generating grid points, we provide the function 
`points_on_cube_grid_d()` that writes to
an output iterator.

We also provide two functions for generating more complex geometric objects.
The function `random_convex_set_2()` computes a random convex planar
point set of a given size where the points are drawn from a specific
domain and `random_polygon_2()` generates a random simple polygon from
points drawn from a specific domain.

\subsection GeneratorRandomPerturbations Random Perturbations

Degenerate input sets like grid points can be randomly perturbed by a
small amount to produce <I>quasi</I>-degenerate test sets. This
challenges numerical stability of algorithms using inexact arithmetic and
exact predicates to compute the sign of expressions slightly off from zero.
For this the function `perturb_points_2()` is provided.

\subsection GeneratorAddingDegeneracies Adding Degeneracies

For a given point set certain kinds of degeneracies can be produced
by adding new points. The `random_selection()` function is
useful for generating multiple copies of identical points.
The function `random_collinear_points_2()` adds collinearities to
a point set.

\subsection GeneratorSupportFunctionsandClassesforGenerators Support Functions and Classes for Generators

The function `random_selection()` chooses `n` items at random from a random
access iterator range which is useful to produce degenerate input data
sets with multiple entries of identical items.

The class `Combination_enumerator<CombinationElement>` is used to enumerate
all fixed-size combinations (subsets) of a range of elements. It is useful
in the context of high-dimensional triangulations, e.g., for enumerating the
faces of a simplex.

\section GeneratorExample_1 Example Generating Degenerate Point Sets

We want to generate a test set of 1000 points, where 60% are chosen
randomly in a small disc, 20% are from a larger grid, 10% are duplicates
points, and 10% collinear points. A random shuffle removes the
construction order from the test set. See \cgalFigureRef{figurePointGenerator}
for the example output.

\section GeneratorExampleGridPoints Example Generating Grid Points

The second example demonstrates the point generators with integer
points. Floating point arithmetic is sufficient to produce
regular integer grids. See \cgalFigureRef{figureIntegerPointGenerator}
for the example output.

\section secsegment_example Examples Generating Segments

The following two examples illustrate the use of the generic functions
from Section \ref STLAlgos like
`Join_input_iterator_2` to generate 
composed objects from other
generators - here two-dimensional segments from two point generators.

We want to generate a test set of 200 segments, where one endpoint is
chosen randomly from a horizontal segment of length 200, and the other
endpoint is chosen randomly from a circle of radius 250. See \cgalFigureRef{figureSegmentGenerator} for the example output.

\cgalExample{Generator/random_segments1.cpp}

\cgalFigureBegin{figureSegmentGenerator,Segment_generator_prog1.png}
Output of example program for the generic segment generator.
\cgalFigureEnd

The second example generates a regular structure of 100 segments; see
\cgalFigureRef{figureSegmentGeneratorFan} for the example output. It uses
the `Points_on_segment_2` iterator, `Join_input_iterator_2` and
`Counting_iterator` to avoid any intermediate storage of the generated
objects until they are used.

\section GeneratorExample_2 Example Generating Point Sets in `d` Dimensions

The following example generates points inside a cube in dimension 5
(examples for ball and sphere are available in the example directory) :

\cgalExample{Generator/cube_d.cpp}

The output of this example looks like:
\verbatim
Generating 10 random points in a cube in 5D, coordinates from -100 to 100
5 32.9521 26.0403 59.3979 -99.2553 15.5102 
5 80.3731 30.809 7.32491 -90.2544 94.5635 
5 -71.3412 -31.933 -98.0734 79.6493 66.6104 
5 -78.5065 -58.2397 -33.9096 81.2196 57.2512 
5 21.4093 26.7661 57.6083 23.4958 93.1047 
5 10.5895 -21.8914 70.9726 36.756 -42.2667 
5 23.9813 54.4519 -26.0894 -85.18 -21.0775 
5 -48.7499 59.9873 6.22335 -4.16011 81.0727 
5 -11.6615 5.53147 -32.6578 -79.9283 44.5679 
5 53.0183 78.3228 -28.5665 83.3503 68.0482 
\endverbatim

Next example generates grid points in dimension `d=4`.
Since the required number of
points, 20 is between \f$ 2^d\f$ and \f$ 3^d\f$ the supporting grid has
\f$ 3\times 3\times 3\times 3\f$ points.
Since the size parameter is 5, the
coordinates are in \f$ \{-5, 0, 5\}\f$, but since the number of points
verifies \f$ 20\leq 3^{d-1}\f$, all
generated points have the same last coordinate \f$ -5\f$.

\cgalExample{Generator/grid_d.cpp}

The output of previous example corresponds to the points of this
figure depicted in red or pink (pink points are "inside" the cube). 
The output is:

\verbatim
Generating 20 grid points in 4D
4 -5 -5 -5 -5 
4 0 -5 -5 -5 
4 5 -5 -5 -5 
4 -5 0 -5 -5 
4 0 0 -5 -5 
4 5 0 -5 -5 
4 -5 5 -5 -5 
4 0 5 -5 -5 
4 5 5 -5 -5 
4 -5 -5 0 -5 
4 0 -5 0 -5 
4 5 -5 0 -5 
4 -5 0 0 -5 
4 0 0 0 -5 
4 5 0 0 -5 
4 -5 5 0 -5 
4 0 5 0 -5 
4 5 5 0 -5 
4 -5 -5 5 -5 
4 0 -5 5 -5 
\endverbatim

\section GeneratorExGenCombi Example Generating Combinations

\subsection GeneratorFromRangeInt From a Range of Integers

The following example enumerates and outputs all subsets of 3 elements from the
range \f$ [10, 15]\f$. Accordingly, it outputs \f$ \frac{6!}{3! 3!}=20\f$
triples.


\cgalExample{Generator/combination_enumerator.cpp}

The output of this example is:
\verbatim
Taking 3 distinct integers in the range [10, 15]: {10 11 12} {10 11 13} {10 11 14}
{10 11 15} {10 12 13} {10 12 14} {10 12 15} {10 13 14} {10 13 15} {10 14 15}
{11 12 13} {11 12 14} {11 12 15} {11 13 14} {11 13 15} {11 14 15} {12 13 14}
{12 13 15} {12 14 15} {13 14 15}
Enumerated 20 combinations.
\endverbatim

\subsection GeneratorFromArrayStr From an Array of Strings
The following example generates all pairs of names from a set of names stored
in an array of strings.

\cgalExample{Generator/name_pairs.cpp}

\section GeneratorDesign Design and Implementation History

Lutz Kettner coded generators in 2D and 3D
For points <I>in</I> and <I>on</I> sphere, points are generated in a cube up
to the moment the point is inside the sphere, then it is normalized to go on the
boundary if needed.

Sven Sch&ouml;nherr implemented the Random class.

Michael Hoffmann coded the random convex polygon,

Geert-Jan Giezeman and Susan Hert coded the random simple polygon.

Olivier Devillers coded generators in high dimensions.
For points <I>in ball</I> and <I>on sphere</I>, points are generated on a
sphere/ball boundary as a product of normal distributions, then it is
normalized.
If needed a random radius (with relevant distribution)
is used to put the point inside the ball.
