\ingroup PkgPeriodic2Triangulation2MainClasses

The class `Periodic_2_Delaunay_triangulation_2` represents a
Delaunay triangulation in two-dimensional periodic space.

\cgalHeading{Parameters}

The class `Periodic_2_Delaunay_triangulation_2` has two template parameters. The first one
\tparam Traits is the geometric traits, it is to be instantiated by a
model of the concept `Periodic_2DelaunayTriangulationTraits_2`.

\tparam Tds is the triangulation data data structure and must be a model of `TriangulationDataStructure_2`
whose vertex and face are models of `Periodic_2TriangulationVertexBase_2` and `Periodic_2TriangulationFaceBase_2`.
It defaults to:
\code
CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2<
  CGAL::Periodic_2_triangulation_vertex_base_2<Gt>,
  CGAL::Periodic_2_triangulation_face_base_2<Gt> > >
\endcode

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

Insertion is implemented by inserting in the triangulation, then
performing a sequence of Delaunay flips. The number of flips is \f$ O(d)\f$
if the new vertex is of degree \f$ d\f$ in the new triangulation. For
points distributed uniformly at random, insertion takes time \f$ O(1)\f$ on
average.

Removal calls the removal in the triangulation and then
re-triangulates the hole in such a way that the Delaunay criterion is
satisfied. Removal of a vertex of degree \f$ d\f$ takes time \f$ O(d^2)\f$. The
expected degree \f$ d\f$ is \f$ O(1)\f$ for a random vertex in the
triangulation.

After a point location step, the nearest neighbor is found in time
\f$ O(n)\f$ in the worst case, but in expected time \f$ O(1)\f$ on average for
vertices distributed uniformly at random and any query point.
