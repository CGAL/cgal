  The concept `PolygonalSchema` defines a 2D polygonal schema, i.e. a combinatorial surface with labeled edges. A PolygonalSchema is created incrementally by adding facets one at a time. A label is any word, that does not contain a space.

  PolygonalSchema::Dart_info should be a class having a public data member std::string m_label.
  PolygonalSchema::dimension should be equal to 2.
