    The class `Curves_on_surface_topology` provides methods to test homotopy on paths. Each object of this class is constructed from an external mesh, either a \ref CombinatorialMap "2D combinatorial map" or a model of a FaceGraph. It maintains a correspondence between this mesh and an internal representation, computed the first time an homotopy test is called. The user must not modify the input surface as long as homotopy tests are performed with this `Curves_on_surface_topology`.
