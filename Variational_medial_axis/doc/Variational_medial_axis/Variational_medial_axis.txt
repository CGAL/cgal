Medial skeleton of a bug model. Given a triangulated mesh(left), the medial skeleton is extracted, where each vertex corresponds a sphere(Middle) and the connectivity of these spheres constructs a mesh(Right) known as <I>Medial mesh</I>

\section VMASIntroduction Introduction

The skeleton is a fundamental structure with numerous applications such as shpae matching, shape segementation, shape deformation, etc. 
A generalization of the skeleton is the medial axis, defined as the set of points that are equidistant to two or more points on the boundary of a shape.

This package implements a medial axis sampling algorithm \cgalCite{huang2024dynamic} that extracts a coarse, discrete approximation of the medial axis from a triangulated surface mesh. 
Unlike the Surface_mesh_skeletonization package, which computes a purely curve-based (1D) skeleton, the output of this method may contain both curve (1D) and surface (2D) elements, a structure sometimes referred to as a meso-skeleton.


\section VMASOverview Overview
The algorithm starts by initializing a single cluster containing all surface vertices, and optimizes a first medial sphere using a variational error metric. 
New spheres are progressively inserted in regions of high approximation error, triggering updates to both the clustering and the set of medial spheres in an iterative optimization loop. 
The process continues until either a target number of spheres or the maximum number of iterations is reached. 
Finally, the connectivity of the medial skeleton is inferred from the adjacency relations between vertex clusters.
