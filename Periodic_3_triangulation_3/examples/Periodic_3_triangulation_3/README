------- example_simple ---------------------------------------

This example shows the incremental construction of a 3D triangulation, 
the location of a point, and how to manipulate elementary operations
on indices in a cell. It uses the default parameters proposed by
CGAL for the Triangulation_3 class.

--------------------------------------------------------------

------- example_color ----------------------------------------

This example shows how the user can plug his own vertex base in a
triangulation.

--------------------------------------------------------------

------- example_adding_handles -------------------------------

This example shows how the user can plug his own vertex base
in a triangulation, when he needs to add handles in it.

--------------------------------------------------------------

------- example_find_conflicts -------------------------------

Illustrates how the insertion process of points in a Delaunay
triangulation can be decomposed in order to give access to the
cells in conflict (those which would be destroyed by the insertion
of a point) prior to deciding to do the actual insertion or not.
TODO: this is not yet implemented like this
