\ccPkgSummary{
This chapter lists the licenses
under which the \cgal\ datastructures and algorithms are distributed,
and the third party libraries on which \cgal\ depends, or for which
\cgal\ provides interfaces.  The chapter further explains how to control
inlining, thread safety, code deprecation, checking of pre- and postconditions,
and how to alter the failure behavior.

Finally, if you want to download and run any of the precompiled demos,
here you can find the dlls that are shared by all of them. Note that
on computer  that does not have Visual C++ 2005 installed, you probably
also need the {\em Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)}. }
