This package offers an efficient and robust implementation of various
Generalized Barycentric Coordinates defined for planar simple polygons.
If coordinates with respect to multivariate scattered 2D points are required,
please refer to Natural Neighbor Coordinates from the package 2D and Surface Function Interpolation.
