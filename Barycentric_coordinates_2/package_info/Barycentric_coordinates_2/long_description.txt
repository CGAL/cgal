This package offers an efficient and robust implementation of various two-dimensional
generalized barycentric coordinates defined for simple two-dimensional polygons.
If coordinates with respect to multivariate scattered points instead of a polygon are required,
please refer to natural neighbor coordinates from the package 2D and Surface Function Interpolation.
