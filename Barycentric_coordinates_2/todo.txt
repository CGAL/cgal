1. To make the code parallel. Get iteration number from the thread. Add parallel class to each type of the coordinate functions. Use begin() + offset. Resize vector. Parallel class takes as parameters list of points and polygon. Use random access iterator. - Done but we have problems with it.

2. Add hard tests with epsilon distance away from the polygon’s boundary, which we have discussed during our first group meeting, to current test suit.

3. Debug the last example. Fix the bug with Projection_traits_xy.
