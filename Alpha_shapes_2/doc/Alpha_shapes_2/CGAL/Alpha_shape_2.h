\ingroup PkgAlphaShapes2Ref

The class `Alpha_shape_2` represents the family of
\f$ \alpha\f$-shapes of points in a plane for <I>all</I> positive
\f$ \alpha\f$. It maintains the underlying triangulation `Dt` which
represents connectivity and order among its faces. Each
\f$ k\f$-dimensional face of the `Dt` is associated with
an interval that specifies for which values of \f$ \alpha\f$ the face
belongs to the \f$ \alpha\f$-shape. There are links between the intervals
and the \f$ k\f$-dimensional faces of the triangulation.

Note that this class is at the same time used for <I>basic</I> and
for <I>weighted</I> Alpha Shapes.

The modifying functions `Alpha_shape_2::insert()` and `Alpha_shape_2::remove()` will overwrite
the one inherited from the underlying triangulation class `Dt`.
At the moment, only the static version is implemented.

\tparam Dt must be either `Delaunay_triangulation_2` or `Regular_triangulation_2`.
Note that `Dt::Geom_traits`, `Dt::Vertex`, and `Dt::Face` must be model the concepts `AlphaShapeTraits_2`,
`AlphaShapeVertex_2` and `AlphaShapeFace_2`, respectively.

\tparam ExactAlphaComparisonTag is a tag that, when set to
\link Tag_true `Tag_true`\endlink, triggers exact comparisons between alpha values. This is useful
when the underlying triangulation is instantiated with an exact predicates inexact constructions
kernel. By default the `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is set to \link Tag_false `Tag_false`\endlink as it induces a small
overhead. Note that the tag `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is currently ignored (meaning that the code will
 behave as if `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` were set to \link Tag_false `Tag_false`\endlink)
if `Dt::Geom_traits::FT` is not a floating point number type as this strategy
does not make sense if the traits class already provides exact constructions.

\warning
<ul>
<li>When the tag `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is set to \link Tag_true `Tag_true`\endlink,
the class `Cartesian_converter` is used internally to switch between the traits class
and the \cgal kernel `CGAL::Simple_cartesian<NT>`, where `NT` can be either `CGAL::Interval_nt` or
`CGAL::Exact_rational`. `Cartesian_converter` must thus offer the necessary functors
to convert a two-dimensional point of the traits class to a two-dimensional point
of `CGAL::Simple_cartesian<NT>`. However, these functors are not necessarily provided by
the basic `Cartesian_converter`. For example when using the traits class `CGAL::Projection_traits_xy_3`,
a `CGAL::Point_3` is camouflaged as a `%Point_2` and the basic `Cartesian_converter` does not know
how to convert from the camouflaged `CGAL::Point_3` to the two-dimensional point
of `CGAL::Simple_cartesian<NT>`. In this case, a partial specialization of `Cartesian_converter`
must be provided by the user. An example of such specialization is given in the example
\ref Alpha_shapes_2/ex_alpha_projection_traits.cpp "ex_alpha_projection_traits.cpp".
<li>The tag `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` cannot be used in conjonction with periodic triangulations.
When the tag `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is set to \link Tag_true `Tag_true`\endlink,
the evaluations of predicates such as `Side_of_oriented_circle_2` are done lazily.
Consequently, the predicates store pointers to the geometrical positions of the
points passed as arguments of the predicates. It is thus important that
these points are not temporary objects. Points of the triangulation are accessed
using the function `point(Face_handle, int)` of the underlying triangulation.
In the case of periodic triangulations, the `point(Face_handle, int)` function
is actually a construction that returns a temporary, which thus cannot be used
along with a lazy predicate evaluation.
</ul>

\cgalHeading{I/O}

The I/O operators are defined for `std::iostream`. The format for the iostream
is an internal format.

\cgalHeading{Implementation}

The set of intervals associated with the
\f$ k\f$-dimensional faces of the underlying triangulation are
stored in `multimaps`.

The cross links between the intervals and the \f$ k\f$-dimensional faces of the
triangulation are realized using methods in the \f$ k\f$-dimensional faces
themselves.

`Alpha_shape_2::alpha_find()` uses linear search, while
`Alpha_shape_2::alpha_lower_bound()` and `Alpha_shape_2::alpha_upper_bound()`
use binary search.
`Alpha_shape_2::number_of_solid_components()` performs a graph traversal and takes time
linear in the number of faces of the underlying triangulation.
`Alpha_shape_2::find_optimal_alpha()` uses binary search and takes time
\f$ O(n \log n)\f$, where \f$ n\f$ is the number of points.

/*!
the number type of alpha values.

In case `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is `CGAL::Tag_false`, it is Gt::FT.

In case `ExactAlphaComparisonTag` is `CGAL::Tag_true`, it is a number type
allowing filtered exact comparisons (that is, interval arithmetic is first used before
resorting to exact arithmetic). Access to the interval containing the exact value is provided through the function
`FT::Approximate_nt approx() const` where `FT::Approximate_nt` is `CGAL::Interval_nt<Protected>`
with `Protected=true`. Access to the exact value is provided through the function
`FT::Exact_nt exact() const` where `FT::Exact_nt` depends on the configuration of \cgal
(it is `Gmpq` if `gmp` is available and `Quotient<CGAL::MP_Float>` otherwise).
An overload for the function `double to_double(FT)` is also available. Its
precision is controlled through `FT::set_relative_precision_of_to_double()` in
exactly the same way as with `Lazy_exact_nt<NT>`, so a call to `to_double` may
trigger an exact evaluation.
It must be noted that an object of type `FT` is valid as long as the alpha shapes class that creates
it is valid and has not been modified.
For convenience, classical comparison operators are provided for the type `FT`.
