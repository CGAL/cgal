Assume we are given a set \f$ S\f$ of points in 2D or 3D and we would like to
have something like "the shape formed by these points". This is
quite a vague notion and there are probably many possible
interpretations, the \f$ \alpha\f$-shape being one of them. Alpha shapes
can be used for shape reconstruction from a dense unorganized set of
data points. Indeed, an \f$ \alpha\f$-shape is demarcated by a frontier,
which is a linear approximation of the original shape \cgalCite{bb-srmua-97t}.

As mentioned in Edelsbrunner's and M&uuml;cke's paper \cgalCite{em-tdas-94},
one can intuitively think of an \f$ \alpha\f$-shape as the
following. Imagine a huge mass of ice-cream making up the space \f$ \mathbb{R}^3\f$
and containing the points as "hard" chocolate pieces. Using one of
these sphere-formed ice-cream spoons, we carve out all parts of the
ice-cream block we can reach without bumping into chocolate pieces,
thereby even carving out holes in the inside (e.g. parts not reachable
by simply moving the spoon from the outside). We will eventually end
up with a (not necessarily convex) object bounded by caps, arcs and
points. If we now straighten all "round" faces to triangles and line
segments, we have an intuitive description of what is called the
\f$ \alpha\f$-shape of \f$ S\f$. The drawing above provides an example
of this process in 2D (where our ice-cream spoon is simply a circle).

Alpha shapes depend on a parameter \f$ \alpha\f$ after which they are named.
In the ice-cream analogy above, \f$ \alpha\f$ is the squared radius of the
carving spoon. A very small value will allow us to eat up all of the
ice-cream except the chocolate points themselves. Thus we already see
that the \f$ \alpha\f$-shape degenerates to the point-set \f$ S\f$ for
\f$ \alpha \rightarrow 0\f$. On the other hand, a huge value of \f$ \alpha\f$
will prevent us even from moving the spoon between two points since
it is too large. So we will never spoon up the ice-cream lying in the
inside of the convex hull of \f$ S\f$. Hence, the alpha shape becomes
the convex hull of \f$ S\f$ as \f$ \alpha \rightarrow \infty\f$.

\cgal offers 2D and 3D alpha shapes. The GUDHI library offers a

\section Alpha_shapes_2Definitions Definitions

We distinguish two versions of alpha shapes. <I>Basic alpha shapes</I>
are based on the Delaunay triangulation. <I>Weighted alpha shapes</I>
are based on its generalization, the regular triangulation
(cf. Section \ref Section_2D_Triangulations_Regular "Regular Triangulations"),
replacing the euclidean distance by the power to weighted points.

There is a close connection between alpha shapes and the underlying
triangulations. More precisely, the \f$ \alpha\f$-complex of \f$ S\f$ is a
subcomplex of this triangulation of \f$ S\f$, containing the \f$ \alpha\f$-exposed
\f$ k\f$-simplices, \f$ 0 \leq k \leq d\f$. A simplex is said to be \f$ \alpha\f$-exposed, if there is an
open disk (resp. ball) of radius \f$ \sqrt{\alpha}\f$ through the vertices of the
simplex that does not contain any other point of \f$ S\f$, for the metric used in
the computation of the underlying triangulation. The corresponding
\f$ \alpha\f$-shape is defined as the underlying interior space of the
\f$ \alpha\f$-complex (see \cgalCite{em-tdas-94}).

In general, an \f$ \alpha\f$-complex is a non-connected and non-pure polytope,
meaning that one \f$ k\f$-simplex, with \f$ 0 \leq k \leq d-1\f$, is not necessarily
adjacent to a \f$ (k+1)\f$-simplex.

The \f$ \alpha\f$-shapes of \f$ S\f$ form a discrete family, even though they
are defined for all real numbers \f$ \alpha\f$ with \f$ 0 \leq \alpha
\leq \infty\f$. Thus, we can represent the entire family of \f$ \alpha\f$-shapes
of \f$ S\f$ by the underlying triangulation of \f$ S\f$. In this representation
each \f$ k\f$-simplex of the underlying triangulation is associated with an
interval that specifies for which values of \f$ \alpha\f$ the \f$ k\f$-simplex
belongs to the \f$ \alpha\f$-shape. Relying on this fact, the family of
\f$ \alpha\f$-shapes can be computed efficiently and relatively
easily. Furthermore, we can select an appropriate \f$ \alpha\f$-shape from a
finite number of different \f$ \alpha\f$-shapes and corresponding
\f$ \alpha\f$-values.

\section I1_SectAlpha_Shape_2 Functionality

The class `Alpha_shape_2<Dt>` represents the family of
\f$ \alpha\f$-shapes of points in a plane for <I>all</I> positive
\f$ \alpha\f$. It maintains the underlying triangulation `Dt` which
represents connectivity and order among squared radius of its faces. Each
\f$ k\f$-dimensional face of the `Dt` is associated with an interval
that specifies for which values of \f$ \alpha\f$ the face belongs to the
\f$ \alpha\f$-shape. There are links between the intervals and the
\f$ k\f$-dimensional faces of the triangulation.

The class `Alpha_shape_2<Dt>` provides functions to set and
get the current \f$ \alpha\f$-value, as well as an iterator that enumerates
the \f$ \alpha\f$-values where the \f$ \alpha\f$-shape changes.

It provides iterators to enumerate the vertices and edges that are in
the \f$ \alpha\f$-shape, and functions that allow to classify vertices,
edges and faces with respect to the \f$ \alpha\f$-shape. They can be in
the interior of a face that belongs or does not belong to the \f$ \alpha\f$-shape.
They can be singular/regular, that is be on the boundary of the \f$ \alpha\f$-shape,
but not incident/incident to a triangle of the \f$ \alpha\f$-complex.

Finally, it provides a function to determine the \f$ \alpha\f$-value
such that the \f$ \alpha\f$-shape satisfies the following two properties,
or at least the second one if there is no such \f$ \alpha\f$ that both
are satisfied: <br>
<ol>
<li> the number of components equals a number of your choice, and
<li> all data points are either on the boundary or in the interior of the regularized version of
the \f$ \alpha\f$-shape (no singular edges).
</ol>

The current implementation is static, that is after its construction
points cannot be inserted or removed.

\section I1_SectDtClass2D Concepts and Models

We currently do not specify concepts for the underlying triangulation
type. Models that work for a basic alpha shape are the classes
`Delaunay_triangulation_2`, `Periodic_2_Delaunay_triangulation_2`, and
`Triangulation_hierarchy_2` templated with a Delaunay
triangulation. A model that works for a weighted alpha shape is
the class `Regular_triangulation_2`.

\subsection AlphaShape2D_ConceptAndModelsAlphaShapes Alpha Shapes

The triangulation needs a geometric traits class as argument.
The requirements of this class are described in the concepts `AlphaShapeTraits_2`
in the non-weighted case and `WeightedAlphaShapeTraits_2` in the weighted case.
All \cgal kernels are models of both concepts.

The triangulation data structure of the triangulation
has to be a model of the concept `TriangulationDataStructure_2`,
whose vertex and face classes are models of the concepts
`AlphaShapeVertex_2` and `AlphaShapeFace_2`, respectively.
The classes `Alpha_shape_vertex_base_2<Gt, Vb>` and `Alpha_shape_face_base_2<Gt, Fb>`
are models of these concepts and can be used for all type of alpha shapes,
provided that the template parameters `Vb` and `Fb` are appropriately chosen,
as we shall see in the following section.

\subsection AlphaShape2D_ConceptAndModelsTDS Triangulation data structure

Additional requirements are put when using weighted or
periodic triangulations as underlying triangulation:
<ul>
<li> When using a weighted triangulation (`Regular_triangulation_2`), the vertex
and face classes must respectively be models to both `AlphaShapeVertex_2` and
`RegularTriangulationVertexBase_2`, and to both
`AlphaShapeFace_2` and `RegularTriangulationFaceBase_2`
(see example: \ref I1_SectWeightedAS2D).
<li> When using a periodic triangulation (`Periodic_2_Delaunay_triangulation_2`),
the vertex and face classes must respectively be models to both `AlphaShapeVertex_2`
and `Periodic_2TriangulationVertexBase_2`,
and to both `AlphaShapeFace_2` and `Periodic_2TriangulationFaceBase_2`
(see example: \ref AlphaShape_2DExampleForPeriodicAlphaShapes).
</ul>

\section Alpha_shapes_2Examples Examples

\subsection I1_SectClassicAS2D Example for Basic Alpha Shapes

The basic alpha shape requires a Delaunay triangulation as
underlying triangulation `Dt`. The Delaunay triangulation class is
parameterized with a geometric and a triangulation data structure traits.

For the geometric traits class we can use a \cgal kernel.

For the triangulation data structure traits, we have to
choose the vertex and face classes needed for alpha shapes,
namely `Alpha_shape_vertex_base_2<Gt, Vb>` and `Alpha_shape_face_base_2<Gt,Fb>`.
The parameter `Vb` and `Fb` must be filled by classes that are models of the
`TriangulationVertexBase_2` and `TriangulationFaceBase_2` concepts. The classes
`Triangulation_vertex_base_2<Gt>` and `Triangulation_face_base_2<Gt>` fit these
requirements.

The example below illustrates how to construct a basic alpha shape.
Note that `Triangulation_vertex_base_2<Gt>` and `Triangulation_face_base_2<Gt>`
are the default parameters for `Vb` and `Fb` in the classes
`Alpha_shape_vertex_base_2<Gt, Vb>` and `Alpha_shape_face_base_2<Gt,Fb>`. They
are thus omitted in the code below.
\cgalExample{Alpha_shapes_2/ex_alpha_shapes_2.cpp}

\subsection I1_SectWeightedAS2D Example for Weighted Alpha Shapes

A weighted alpha shape requires a regular triangulation as
underlying triangulation `Dt`.
Here again, we can use the vertex and face `Alpha_shape_vertex_base_2<Gt, Vb>`
and `Alpha_shape_face_base_2<Gt,Fb>`, but for weighted alpha shapes, `Vb` and `Fb`
must be models of the concepts `RegularTriangulationVertexBase_2` and
`RegularTriangulationFaceBase_2`. The classes `Regular_triangulation_vertex_base_2<Gt>`
`Regular_triangulation_face_base_2<Gt>` fit these requirements.

Note that there is no special weighted alpha shape class.

The example below illustrates how to construct a weighted alpha shape.
\cgalExample{Alpha_shapes_2/ex_weighted_alpha_shapes_2.cpp}

\subsection AlphaShape_2DExampleForPeriodicAlphaShapes Example for Periodic Alpha Shapes
The following example shows how to use a periodic Delaunay
triangulation as underlying triangulation for the alpha shape computation.

In order to define the original domain and to benefit from the
built-in heuristic optimizations of the periodic triangulation computation,
it is recommended to first construct the triangulation and
then construct the alpha shape from it. The alpha
shape constructor that takes a point range can be used as well but in
this case the original domain cannot be specified and the default unit
cube will be chosen and no optimizations will be used.

It is also recommended to switch the triangulation to 1-sheeted
covering if possible. Note that a periodic triangulation in 9-sheeted
covering space is degenerate. In this case, an exact constructions
kernel needs to be used to compute the alpha shapes. Otherwise the
results will suffer from round-off problems.
