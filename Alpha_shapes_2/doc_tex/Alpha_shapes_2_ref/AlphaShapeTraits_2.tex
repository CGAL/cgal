\begin{ccRefConcept} {AlphaShapeTraits_2}

\ccCreationVariable{t}

\ccDefinition
A model of the concept \ccRefName\  must provide the following predicate and
operations in addition to the requirements for the underlying triangulation
traits class.
It means, the metric has to be Euclidean for Delaunay triangulation or the power 
metric for regular triangulation.

\ccRefines
\ccc{TriangulationTraits_2}


\ccHasModels

The kernels supplied by \cgal\ are models of \ccRefName. 


\ccTypes

\ccNestedType{FT}{A type to hold a coordinate type class. 
The type must provide a copy constructor, assignment, comparison
operators, negation, multiplication, division and allow the
declaration and initialization with a small integer constant
(cf. requirements for number types). 
\ccPrecond An obvious choice would be coordinate type of the point class.}

\ccCreation

Only a default constructor is required. Note that further constructors
can be provided. 

\ccConstructor{Gt();}
{A default constructor.}

\ccHeading{Constructions by function objects}

\ccMethod{Compute_squared_radius_2 compute_squared_radius_2_object();} 
{Returns an object, which has to be able to compute the squared radius of the
circle of the points \ccc{p0, p1, p2} or the squared radius of smallest  circle
of the points \ccc{p0, p1}, as \ccc{FT} associated with {\em the metric used
by \ccc{Dt}}.} 

\ccHeading{Predicate by function object}

\ccMethod{Side_of_bounded_circle_2 side_of_bounded_circle_2_object();}
{Returns an object, which has to be able to compute the relative position of
point \ccc{test} to the smallest circle of the points \ccc{p0, p1}, using
{\em the same metric as \ccc{Dt}}.}
