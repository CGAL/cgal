The package 2D Periodic Hyperbolic Triangulation provides Delaunay triangulations
of the Bolza surface, the most symmetric closed orientable surface of genus 2.
Triangulations of the Bolza surface can be seen as periodic triangulations in the
Poincaré disk model of the hyperbolic plane. The package includes demos, examples,
and tests. More information can be found in:

        the Bolza surface. In Proceedings of the Thirty-third International Symposium
        on Computational Geometry, pages 44:1–44:15, 2017.
