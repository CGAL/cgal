\cgalPkgDesc{This package enables building and handling triangulations of point sets on the two dimensional
hyperbolic Bolza surface. Triangulations are built incrementally and can be modified by insertion or
removal of vertices. Point location facilities are also offered. The package provides Delaunay
triangulations and offers primitives to build the dual Voronoi diagrams.}

\cgalPkgDescriptionEnd


\cgal traditionally represents a triangulation via its faces and vertices. We represent a triangulation of the
Bolza surface via the canonical representatives of its faces in the hyperbolic plane. This package provides the
necessary objects and functions to work with Delaunay triangulations of the Bolza surface.

Each vertex gives access to one of its incident faces, and stores an input point. We additionally allow each
vertex to store (temporarily) a hyperbolic translation to facilitate the insertion of new points and the removal
of existing vertices.

Each face gives access to its three incident vertices and to its three adjacent faces. We enable a face
to store additionally three hyperbolic translations. When applied to the three points stored in the vertices of
the face, these translations produce the canonical representative of the face in the hyperbolic plane.

The three vertices of a face are indexed with 0, 1, and 2 in positive (counter-clockwise) orientation. The
orientation of faces on the Bolza surface is defined as the orientation of their canonical representatives in
the hyperbolic plane.
