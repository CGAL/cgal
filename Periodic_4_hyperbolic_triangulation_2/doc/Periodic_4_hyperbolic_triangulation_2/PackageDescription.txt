\cgalPkgDesc{This package allows to build and handle triangulations of point sets on the two dimensional
hyperbolic Bolza surface. Triangulations are built incrementally and can be modified by insertion or
removal of vertices. Point location facilities are also offered. The package provides Delaunay
triangulations and offers primitives to build the dual Voronoi diagrams.}

\cgalModifBegin

\cgal traditionally represents a triangulation via its faces and vertices. We represent a triangulation of the 
Bolza surface via the canonical representatives of its faces in the hyperbolic plane. This package provides the
necessary objects and functions to work with Delaunay triangulations of the Bolza surface.

Each vertex gives access to one of its incident faces, and stores an input point. We additionally allow each 
vertex to store (temporarily) a hyperbolic translation to facilitate the insertion of new points and the removal 
of existing vertices.

Each face gives access to its three incident vertices and to its three adjacent faces. We enable a face 
to store additionally three hyperbolic translations. When applied to the three points stored in the vertices of 
the face, these translations produce the canonical representative of the face in the hyperbolic plane.

The three vertices of a face are indexed with 0, 1, and 2 in positive (counter-clockwise) orientation. The 
orientation of faces on the Bolza surface is defined as the orientation of their canonical representatives in 
the hyperbolic plane.

## Concepts ##

The concepts in this package provide an interface for working with objects in the hyperbolic plane, including
hyperbolic translations, which allow us to represent a triangulation of the Bolza surface. The concept
`Periodic_4HyperbolicTriangulationTraits_2` refines the concept `HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2`
and adds the functionality needed to apply hyperbolic translations to geometric objects in the hyperbolic plane.
- `Periodic_4HyperbolicTriangulationTraits_2`

The concept `Periodic_4HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2` refines `Periodic_4HyperbolicTriangulationTraits_2`
and adds functionality needed for the removal of vertices from a Delaunay triangulation of the Bolza surface.
- `Periodic_4HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2`

The concepts `Periodic_4HyperbolicTriangulationDSFaceBase_2` and `Periodic_4HyperbolicTriangulationDSFaceBase_2`
describe the requirements for the faces and the vertices of a triangulation of the Bolza surface. A face needs
to be able to store hyperbolic translations as a canonical representative. A vertex needs to be able to store
temporarily hyperbolic translations to facilitate insertion and removal procedures.

- `Periodic_4HyperbolicTriangulationDSVertexBase_2`


## Classes ##

The main class of the 2D Periodic Triangulation package is `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_2`. 
This class allows to construct and modify Delaunay triangulations of the Bolza surface. A secondary 
class made available is `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_triangulation_2`, which gives access 
to the elements of the triangulation (vertices, edges, and faces), and functionality common to 
triangulations in general, such as point location. The class `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_triangulation_2` 
does <i>not</i> support insertion or removal of points. `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_2`
inherits `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_triangulation_2`.
- `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_triangulation_2`
- `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_2`

The package provides a model for the concept `Periodic_4HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2`, which
is the class `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_traits_2`. 
- `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_traits_2`

Models for the face and vertex concepts are provided as well.
- `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_triangulation_ds_face_base_2`
- `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_triangulation_ds_vertex_base_2`

Finally, the package provides a class to represent hyperbolic translations of the fundamental group \f$\mathcal G\f$ 
of the Bolza surface.
- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_octagon_translation`
