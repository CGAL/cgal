The CGAL software consists of several parts, each of which is licensed under
an open source license. It is also possible to obtain commercial licenses
from GeometryFactory (www.geometryfactory.com) for all or parts of CGAL.

The source code of the CGAL library can be found in the directories
"src/CGAL", "src/CGALQt", "src/CGALQt5" and "include/CGAL" (with the
exception of "include/CGAL/CORE", "include/CGAL/OpenNL").
It is specified in each file of the CGAL library which
license applies to it. This is either the GNU General Public License
or the GNU Lesser General Public License (as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 3 of the License or (at your option) any later
version). The texts of both licenses can be found in the files LICENSE.GPL
and LICENSE.LGPL.
