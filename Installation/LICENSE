The CGAL software consists of several parts, each of which is licensed under
an open source license. It is also possible to obtain commercial licenses
from GeometryFactory (www.geometryfactory.com) for all or parts of CGAL.

The source code of the CGAL library can be found in the directories
"src/CGAL", "src/CGALQt", "src/CGALQt4" and "include/CGAL" (with the
exception of "include/CGAL/CORE", "include/CGAL/OpenNL" and
"include/CGAL/PDB"). It is specified in each file of the CGAL library which
license applies to it. This is either the GNU Lesser General Public License
(as published by the Free Software Foundation; version 2.1 of the License)
or the Q Public License (version 1.0), *depending on each file*. The texts
of both licenses can be found in the files LICENSE.LGPL and LICENSE.QPL.  

Distributed along with CGAL (for the users' convenience), but not part of
CGAL, are the following third-party libraries, available under their own
licenses:

- CORE, in the directories "include/CGAL/CORE" and "src/CGALCore", is
  licensed under the QPL (see LICENSE.QPL).
- ImageIO, in the directory "src/CGALimageIO", is licensed under the LGPL
  (see LICENSE.LGPL).
- PDB, in the directory "include/CGAL/PDB" and "src/CGALPDB" is licensed
  under the LGPL (see LICENSE.LGPL).
- OpenNL, in the directory "include/CGAL/OpenNL", is licensed under the LGPL
  (see LICENSE.LGPL).

All other files that do not have an explicit copyright notice (e.g., all
examples and some demos) are licensed under a very permissive license. The
exact license text can be found in the file LICENSE.FREE_USE.
