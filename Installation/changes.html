<h2 id="release3.10">Release 3.10 </h2>
<DIV>
<p> Release date: XXX 2012</p>

<p>
CGAL 3.10 offers the following improvements and new functionality :  </p>

<h3>AABB tree</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Document constness of member functions of the <code>AABB_tree</code> class.</li>
  <li>The class <code>AABB_tree</code> is now guaranteed to be read-only thread-safe. As usual in CGAL, 
      this small overhead introduced for thread-safety can be deactivated by defining <code>CGAL_HAS_NO_THREADS</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Geometric Object Generators</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <code>Random_points_in_iso_box_d</code> (deprecated since 3.8) has been
  removed. Use <code>Random_points_in_cube_d</code> instead.
</ul>

<h3>Linear_cell_complex (new package)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This package implements linear cell complexes, objects in
    d-dimension  with linear geometry. The combinatorial part of
    objects is described by a combinatorial map, representing all the
    cells of the object plus the incidence and adjacency relations
    between cells. Geometry is added on combinatorial maps simply by
    associating a Point to each vertex of the map.  This data
    structure can be seen as the generalization in dD of the 
    <code>Polyhedron_3</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spatial Searching</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The const-correctness of this package have been worked out. The transition for users should be smooth in
  general, however adding few const in user code might be needed in some cases.
  </li>
  <li>The class <code>Kd_tree</code> is now guaranteed to be read-only thread-safe. As usual in CGAL, 
      this small overhead introduced for thread-safety can be deactivated by defining <code>CGAL_HAS_NO_THREADS</code>.</li>  
  <li>Bug-fix in <code>Orthogonal_incremental_neighbor_search</code> and <code>Incremental_neighbor_search</code> classes. Several calls to <code>begin()</code>
      now allow to make several nearest neighbor search queries independently.</li>  
</ul>

<h3>STL extension</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>CGAL::copy_n</code> is now deprecated for <code>CGAL::cpp0x::copy_n</code> which uses <code>std::copy_n</code>, if available on the platform.</li>
  <li><code>CGAL::successor</code> and <code>CGAL::predecessor</code> are now deprecated for <code>CGAL::cpp0x::next</code> and <code>CGAL::cpp0x::prev</code>. These functions
  use the standard versions if available on the platform. Otherwise, <code>boost::next</code> and <code>boost::prior</code> are used.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Triangulation_2</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Fix a thread-safety issue in <code>Delaunay_triangulation_2</code> remove functions.  As usual in CGAL, 
      the small overhead introduced for thread-safety can be deactivated by defining <code>CGAL_HAS_NO_THREADS</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="release3.9">Release 3.9 </h2>
<DIV>
<p> Release date: September 2011</p>

<p>
CGAL 3.9 offers the following improvements and new functionality :  </p>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The class <code>Root_of_2</code> is now deprecated. It is recommended to use the class <code>Sqrt_extension</code> instead.</li>
  <li>The class <code>Sqrt_extension</code> is now used everywhere in CGAL where an algebraic number of degree 2 is needed. 
      This change has been done in the <code>Root_of_traits</code> mechanism (indirectly packages 2D Circular kernel and 3D Spherical kernel)
      and the packages 2D Segment Delaunay Graphs and 2D Arrangements.</li>
  <li>Various fixes in the manual.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Combinatorial Maps (new package)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This package provides a new combinatorial data structure allowing to describe any orientable subdivided object whatever its dimension.
  It describes all cells of the subdivision and all the incidence and adjacency relations between these cells.
  For example it allows to describe a 3D object subdivided in vertices, edges, faces and volumes.
  This data structure can be seen as the generalization in dD of the haldedge data structure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3D Convex Hull (major performance improvement)</h3>
<ul>
      <li>The quickhull implementation of CGAL (<code>CGAL::convex_hull_3</code>)
          has been worked out to provide very better performances.</li>
      <li>The function <code>CGAL::convex_hull_3</code> no longer computes the plane
          equations of the facets of the output polyhedron. However an example is 
          provided to show how to compute them easily.</li>
      <li>A global function <code>convex_hull_3_to_polyhedron_3</code> is now provided to extract
      the convex hull of a 3D points set from a triangulation of these points.</li>
</ul>

<h3>dD Spatial Searching (major new feature added)</h3>
<ul>
      <li>A traits-class and distance adapter that together with a point property map,
       allow to make nearest neighbor queries on keys instead of points have been added.</li> 
      <li>Few bug fixes in the documentation have revealed some inconsistencies 
      that have been corrected. Two traits class concept are now documented (<code>RangeSearchTraits</code> 
      and <code>SearchTraits</code>). Most other changes concerns only classes documented as advanced. 
      One issue that user can encounter is due to an additional requirement on the nested 
      class <code>Construct_cartesian_const_iterator_d</code> defined in the concept SearchTraits that must 
      provide a nested type <code>result_type</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spatial Sorting  (major new feature added)</h3>
<ul>
      <li>General dimension is now supported.</li>
      <li>Hilbert sorting admits now two policies: splitting at
      median or at middle (see user manual).</li>
      <li>Using a property map, sorting on keys instead of points is now easier</li> 
</ul>

<h3>dD Kernel</h3>
<ul>
      <li>The d-dimensional kernel concept and models have been modified 
          to additionally provide two new functors <code>Less_coordinate_d</code> and <code>Point_dimension_d</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2D Arrangements</h3>
<ul>
      <li>A new geometry-traits class that handles rational arcs, namely
	<code>Arr_rational_function_traits_2</code>, has been introduced.
	It replaced an old traits class, which handled the same family of
	curves, but it was less efficient. The new traits exploits CGAL
	algebraic kernels and polynomials, which were not available at
	the time the old traits class was developed.</li>
      <li>A new geometry traits concept called
	<code>ArrangementOpenBoundaryTraits_2</code> has been introduced.
	A model of this concept suports curves that approach the open
	boundary of an iso-rectangular area called parameter space, which can
	be unbounded or bounded. The general code of the package, however,
	supports only the unbounded parameter space. We intend to enhance the
	general code to support also bounded parameter spaces in a future
	release.</li>
      <li>The deprecated member function <code>is_at_infinity()</code> of
        <code>Arrangement_2::Vertex</code> has been removed. It has been previously
        replaced new function <code>is_at_open_boundary()</code>.
  
      <li> The tags in the geometry traits that indicate the type of boundary of 
       the embedding surface were replaced by the following new tags:
<pre>
         Left_side_category
         Bottom_side_category
         Top_side_category
         Right_side_category
</pre>
       It is still possible not to indicate the tags at all. Default values are assumed. This however will
       produce warning messages, and should be avoided.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="release3.8">Release 3.8 </h2>
<DIV>
<p> Release date: April 2011</p>

<p>
CGAL 3.8 offers the following improvements and new functionality :  </p>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Boost version 1.39 at least is now required.</li>
  <li>Initial support for the LLVM Clang compiler (prereleases of version 2.9).</li>
  <li>Full support for the options -strict-ansi of the Intel Compiler 11,
  and -ansi of the GNU g++ compiler.</li>
  <li>Adding a concept of ranges. In the following releases, it will be the 
      way to provide a set of objects (vs. a couple of iterators).</li>
  <li>Fix a memory leak in CORE polynomials.</li>
  <li>Various fixes in the manual.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3D Mesh Generation (major new feature added)</h3>
<ul>

      a 3D Delaunay and regular triangulation.
  <li>Add a member function to remove a cluster of points from a Delaunay or 
      regular triangulation.
  <li>function vertices_in_conflict is renamed vertices_on_conflict_zone_boundary
      for Delaunay and regular triangulation. Function vertices_inside_conflict_zone
      is added to regular triangulation.
  <li>Structural filtering is now internally used in locate function of Delaunay
      and regular triangulation. It improves average construction time by 20%.
  <li>Added demo.
</ul>

<h3>3D Alpha Shapes (major new feature added)</h3>
<ul>
  <li> The new class Fixed_alpha_shape_3 provides a robust and
       faster way to compute one alpha shape (with a fixed value of alpha).
</ul>


<h3>AABB tree</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Adding the possibility to iteratively add primitives to an existing 
      tree and to build it only when no further insertion is needed.
</ul>

<h3>2D and 3D Kernel</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Better handling of 2D points with elevation (3D points projected onto 
      trivial planes). More general traits classes (Projection_traits_xy_3,
      Projection_traits_yz_3,Projection_traits_yz_3) are provided to work with
      triangulations, algorithms on polygons, alpha-shapes, convex hull algorithm...
      Usage of former equivalent traits classes in different packages is now deprecated.
  <li>Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel now better use the static filters
      which leads to performance improvements.
  <li>Add an overload for the global function angle, taking three 3D points.
  <li>In the 2D and 3D kernel concept, the constant Boolean Has_filtered_predicates 
      is now deprecated. It is now required to use Has_filtered_predicates_tag
      (being either Tag_true or Tag_false).
  <li>Compare_distance_2 and Compare_distance_3 provide additional operators
      for 3 and 4 elements.
  <li>Add intersection test and intersection computation capabilities
      between an object of type Ray_3 and either an object of type Line_3, Segment_3 or Ray_3.
  <li>Improve intersection test performance between an object of type Bbox_3 and an object of type 
      Plane_3 or Triangle_3 by avoiding arithmetic filter failures.
</ul>

<h3>2D Envelope</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Env_default_diagram_1 is deprecated, Envelope_diagram_1 should be used instead.
</ul>

<h3>3D Envelope</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A new demo program called <tt>L1_Voronoi_diagram_2</tt> has been
    introduced. It demonstrates how 2D Voronoi diagrams of points under

</DIV>

<h2 id="release3.7">Release 3.7 </h2>
<DIV>
<p> Release date: October 2010</p>

<p>
CGAL 3.7 offers the following improvements and new functionality :  </p>


<h3>General</h3>

  <ul>
  <li>The configuration of CGAL libraries now requires CMake>=2.6.

  <li>Changes in the set of supported platforms:
    <ul>
    <li>GNU g++ 4.5 supported (with or without the compilation option
      -std=c++0x).

    <li>Initial support for the option -strict-ansi of the Intel Compiler 11.
      The CGAL libraries compile with that option, and most CGAL headers
      have been fixed. The packages "3D Boolean Operations on Nef
      Polyhedra" (Nef_3), "Convex Decomposition of Polyhedra"
      (Convex_decomposition_3), and "3D Minkowski Sum of Polyhedra"
      (Minkowski_sum_3) are known to still fail to compile with that
      compiler flag.

    <li>The Microsoft Windows Visual C++ compiler 2010 (VC10), that was
      experimentally supported by CGAL-3.6.1, is now fully supported. Note
      that CMake>=2.8.2 is required for that support.

    <li>The Microsoft Windows Visual C++ compiler 2005 (VC8) is no longer
      supported by the CGAL project since CGAL-3.7.

    <li>With Microsoft Windows Visual C++ (VC9 and VC10), the optional
      dependencies Gmp, Mpfr, Blas, Lapack, Taucs no longer use Boost-style
      name mangling. Only one variant is now provided by the CGAL Windows
      installer (release, with dynamic runtime).
    </ul>
  <li>Some demos now require a version of Qt4 >= 4.3.

  <li>CGAL_PDB is no longer provided with CGAL. An alternative solution for
    people interested in reading PDB files is to use ESBTL
    (http://esbtl.sourceforge.net/).

  <li>Fix issues of the CGAL wrappers around the CORE library, on 64 bits
    platforms.
  </ul>


<h3>Arithmetic and Algebra</h3>
<ul>
  <li> New models Algebraic_kernel_d_1 and Algebraic_kernel_d_2 for the
    corresponding concepts. They provide generic support for various 
    coefficient types
</ul>

<h3>Arrangements</h3>
<ul>
  <li> A new model Arr_algebraic_segment_traits_2 of ArrangementTraits_2 that
    supports algebraic curves of arbitrary degree in the plane
</ul>


<h3> 2D Triangulations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Delaunay and regular 2D triangulations now use a symbolic
    perturbation to choose a particular triangulation in co-circular cases.

  <li>The return type of the template member function 
    insert(It beg, It end), taking an iterator range of points,
    has been changed from int to std::ptrdiff_t.

  <li>Classes Triangulation_euclidean_traits_xy_3, Triangulation_euclidean_traits_yz_3
    and Triangulation_euclidean_traits_xz_3 are now model of the concept 
    ConstrainedTriangulationTraits_2. They can be used with and without intersection
    of constraints.

  <li>2D Delaunay and basic triangulations now provide vertex relocation by
    the mean of these two new methods: move and move_if_no_collision. The
    methods are also available for the hierarchy
    (Triangulation_hierarchy_2).

</ul>

<h3>3D Triangulations</h3>
   <ul>
  <li>The return type of the template member function 
    insert(It beg, It end), taking an iterator range of points,
    has been changed from int to std::ptrdiff_t.
  <li>3D Delaunay triangulations now provide vertex relocation by the mean
    of these two new methods: move and move_if_no_collision. This works in
    both Compact_policy and Fast_policy.
</ul>

<h3>2D and 3D Alpha Shapes</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>The type int in the API has been changed to std::size_t
    so that CGAL can deal with large data sets (64 bit addresses).
  </ul>


<h3>2D Mesh Generation</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>The execution of the 2D mesh generator is now deterministic (same at
    each run).
  </ul>

<h3>3D Mesh Generation</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>The efficiency of the 3D mesh generator has been improved (the number
    of calls to the oracle per inserted vertex has globally decrease).
    This is achieved through a slight change of the mesh generator strategy
    which implies that a surface component that is not detected at the
    surface mesher level will never be discovered by chance, owing to the
    refinement of some tetrahedra, as it could happen before.
    Please note that defining the macro
    CGAL_MESH_3_USE_OLD_SURFACE_RESTRICTED_DELAUNAY_UPDATE switches back to
    the old behavior.

  <li>A demo program is now available.
  </ul>

<h3>Surface Reconstruction from Point Sets</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Improved performance and minor bug fix.
  </ul>

 	
<h3>2D Range and Neighbor Search</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>The type int in the API has been changed to std::size_t
    so that CGAL can deal with large data sets (64 bit addresses).
</ul>

</DIV>



<h2 id="release3.6.1">Release 3.6.1</h2>

<DIV>
<p>Release date: June 2010</p>

<p>
This is a bug fix release. The following has been changed
since CGAL-3.6:</p>

<h3>General</h3>

  <ul>
  <li> Fix compilation errors with recent Boost versions (since 1.40).

  <li> Initial support for the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler 10.0 (MSVC
    2010). For that support, CMake>=2.8.2 is required.
    Note also that the compiler option "/bigobj" is necessary to compile
    some CGAL programs with MSVC 2010.
</ul>


<h3>Polynomial</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix compilation errors with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler and the
    Intel C++ compiler.
</ul>

<h3> Polyhedron</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Fix a compilation errors in demo/Polyhedron/:
     <li> issue with the location of qglobal.h of Qt4 on MacOS X,
     <li> missing texture.cpp, if TAUCS is used,
  <li> Fix the location of built plugins of demo/Polyhedron/, when CGAL is
    configured with WITH_demos=ON
</ul>

<h3> 3D Periodic Triangulations</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Fixed bug in the triangulation hierarchy for periodic triangulations.
</ul>

<h3> 2D Mesh Generation</h3>
<ul>
   <li> Fix a bug that lead to precondition violation.
  <li> Improve the user manual about the member function is_in_domain() of the
    Face type.
  <li> The 2D meshing process is now deterministic (sorting of bad faces no
    longer relies on pointers comparisons).
</ul>

<h3> 3D Mesh Generation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix a linking errors (duplicate symbols) when <code>&lt;CGAL/refine_mesh_3.h&gt;</code> is
    included in different compilation units.
</ul>

<h3> Spatial Searching</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Fix a bug in <code>&lt;CGAL/Orthogonal_k_neighbor_search.h&gt;</code> when several
    nearest neighbors are at the same distance from the query point.
</ul>

<h3> IO Streams</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix a bug in <code>&lt;CGAL/IO/VRML_2_ostream.h&gt;</code> that generated VRML 2 files with
    an invalid syntax for IndexedFaceSet nodes.
</ul>

<h3> Triangulation_2</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Add missing Compare_distance_2 functor in trait classes Triangulation_euclidean_traits_xy_3
    Triangulation_euclidean_traits_yz_3 and Triangulation_euclidean_traits_xz_3.
    This was preventing calling member function nearest_vertex of Delaunay_triangulation_2
    instantiated with one of these traits.
    </ul>
</DIV>

<h2 id="release3.6">Release 3.6</h2>

<DIV>

<li> Introduced Arrangement_2::fictitious_face(), which returns the fictitious
    face in case of an unbounded arrangement.

<li> Fixed a bug in Bezier-curve handling.

<li> Added (back) iterator, number_of_holes(), holes_begin(), and holes_end()
    to the default DCEL for backward compatibility.

<li> Added (simple) versions of the free overlay() function. It employs the
    default overlay-traits, which practically does nothing.
</ul>

<h3> Polyhedron</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Fix a compilation errors in demo/Polyhedron/:
   <ul>
     <li> issue with the location of qglobal.h of Qt4 on MacOS X,
     <li> missing texture.cpp, if TAUCS is used,
   </ul>
  <li> Fix the location of built plugins of demo/Polyhedron/, when CGAL is
    configured with WITH_demos=ON
  <li> Fix a bug in test_facet function of the incremental builder:    
    the function did not test if while a new facet makes a vertex manifold,
    no other facet incident to that vertex breaks the manifold property.
</ul>

<h3>Triangulations and Delaunay Triangulations</h3>

<h4>2D/3D Regular Triangulations</h4>

<ul><li> Weighted_point now has a constructor from Cartesian coordinates.
</ul>

<h4>3D Triangulations</h4>

<ul><li> Regular_triangulation_3 : semi-static floating-point filters are now used
    in its predicates, which can speed up its construction by a factor of about 3
    when Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel is used.

<li> The class Regular_triangulation_filtered_traits_3 is deprecated, the class
    Regular_triangulation_euclidean_traits_3 must be used instead. The
    predicates of that traits will be filtered if the kernel given as template
    parameter of that traits is itself a filtered kernel.

<li> Triangulation_hierarchy_3 is now deprecated, and replaced by a simpler
    CGAL::Fast_location policy template parameter of Delaunay_triangulation_3.

<li> The old version of remove() (enabled with CGAL_DELAUNAY_3_OLD_REMOVE)
    has been deleted.
</ul>

<h4>3D Periodic Triangulations</h4>

<ul><li> New demo: 3D periodic Lloyd algorithm.

<li> New functionality for Voronoi diagrams: dual of an edge and of a vertex, 
    volume and centroid of the dual of a vertex. 

<li> The package can now be used with the 3D Alpha Shapes package to compute 
    periodic alpha shapes. 
</ul>

<h4>3D Alpha shapes</h4>

<ul><li> The class Weighted_alpha_shape_euclidean_traits_3 is deprecated, the class
    Regular_triangulation_euclidean_traits_3 must be used instead.

<li> The package can now be used together with the 3D Periodic Triangulation 
    package to compute periodic alpha shapes. 
</ul>

<h4>2D/3D Triangulations, 2D Segment Delaunay Graph, 2D Apollonius Graph,
  and 3D Periodic Triangulations</h4>

<ul><li>The constructor and insert function taking ranges now produce
    structures whose iterator orders is now deterministic (same at each
    run).
</ul>


<h3>Mesh Generation</h3>

<h4>2D Mesh Generation</h4>

<ul><li> The 2D mesh generator can now be used with a constrained Delaunay
    triangulation with constraints hierarchy
    (Constrained_triangulation_plus_2).
    <li> In some cases (refinement of a constrained edge that is on the
    convex hull), the 2D mesh generator from CGAL-3.4 and CGAL-3.5
    could create invalid triangulations. This bug is now fixed.
</ul>

<h4>3D Mesh Generation</h4>

<ul><li> The mesh generator has been enriched with an optimization phase to
    provide 3D meshes with well shaped tetrahedra (and in particular no
    slivers).  The optimization phase involves four different optimization
    processes: two global optimization processes (ODT and Lloyd), a
    perturber and an exuder. Each of these processes can be activated or
    not, and tuned to the users needs and to available computer resources.
</ul>

<h2  id="release3.5">Release 3.5</h2>
<DIV>
<p>Release date: October 2009</p>
<p>
  CGAL releases will now be published about every six months. As a transition
  release, CGAL-3.5 has been developed during 9 months from the release
  CGAL-3.4.</p>

<p>Version 3.5 differs from version 3.4 in the platforms that are supported and
  in functionality.  There have also been a number of bug fixes for this release.</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Additional supported platforms:
    <ul>
      <li>GNU g++ 4.4 supported.
      <li>Intel Compiler 11 supported on Linux
    </ul>
  <li>Fixed ABI incompatibilities when mixing CGAL and Boost Program Options
    on Windows/Visual C++ (the compilation flag -D_SECURE_SCL=0 is not
    longer use in Debug mode).
</ul>

<h3>Geometry Kernels</h3>

<h4>3D Spherical Geometry Kernel</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Add functionalities to manipulate circles, circular arcs and points
    that belong to the same sphere.

</ul>
<h3>Polygons</h3>

<h4>2D Regularized Boolean Set-Operations</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The polygon validation operations were enhanced and their interface was
    improved. They are now offered as free functions and applied properly.

</ul>
<h4>2D Straight Skeleton and Polygon Offsetting </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Updated the manual to document the new partial skeletons feature
    (already in the code since 3.4)

</ul>

<h3>Arrangements</h3>

<h4>2D Arrangements</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The member function is_at_infinity() of Arrangement_2::Vertex was
    replaced by the new function is_at_open_boundary(). The former is
    deprecated. While still supported in version 3.5, It will not be
    supported in future releases. The member functions boundary_type_in_x()
    and boundary_type_in_y() were permanently replaced by the functions
    parameter_space_in_x() and parameter_space_in_y(), respectively. The 2
    new functions return an enumeration of a new type, namely
    Arr_parameter_space.

  <li> The tags in the geometry traits that indicate the type of boundary of 
    the embedding surface were replaced by the following new tags:
    Arr_left_side_tag
    Arr_bottom_side_tag
    Arr_top_side_tag
    Arr_right_side_tag
    In addition, the code was change, and now it is possible not to
    indicate the tags at all. Default values are assumed. This however will
    produce warning messages, and should be avoided.

  <li> All operations of the geometry traits-class were made 'const'. This
    change was reflected in the code of this package and all other packages
    that are based on it. Traits classes that maintain state, should
    declare the data members that store the state as mutable.

</ul>
<h4>Envelopes of Surfaces in 3D</h4>
<ul>
  <li> A few bugs in the code that computes envelopes were fixed, in
    particular in the code that computes the envelopes of planes.

</ul>

<h3>Triangulations and Delaunay Triangulations</h3>

<h4>3D Periodic Triangulations (new package)</h4>

<ul>
  <li> This package allows to build and handle triangulations of point sets in
    the three dimensional flat torus. Triangulations are built
    incrementally and can be modified by insertion or removal of
    vertices. They offer point location facilities.

</ul>

<h3>Mesh Generation</h3>

<h4>Surface Reconstruction from Point Sets (new package)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> This CGAL package implements an implicit surface reconstruction method:
    Poisson Surface Reconstruction. The input is an unorganized point set
    with oriented normals.

</ul>
<h4>3D Mesh Generation (new package)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> This package generates 3 dimensional meshes.  It computes isotropic
    simplicial meshes for domains or multidomains provided that a domain
    descriptor, able to answer queries from a few different types on the
    domain, is given.  In the current version, Mesh_3 generate meshes for
    domain described through implicit functional, 3D images or polyhedral
    boundaries.  The output is a 3D mesh of the domain volume and conformal
    surface meshes for all the boundary and subdividing surfaces.

</ul>
<h3>Geometry Processing</h3>

<h4>Triangulated Surface Mesh Simplification</h4>

<ul>
  <li>  BREAKING API change in the passing of the visitor object.

  <li>  Added a geometric test to avoid folding of facets

  <li>  Fixed a bug in the handling of overflow in the LindstromTurk
    computations

  <li>  Updated the manual to account for the new visitor interface

</ul>
<h4>Point Set Processing (new package)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>  This packages implements a set of algorithms for analysis, processing,
    and normal estimation and orientation of point sets.

</ul>

<h3>Spatial Searching and Sorting</h3>

<h4>AABB tree (new package)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This package implements a hierarchy of axis-aligned bounding boxes (a
    AABB tree) for efficient intersection and distance computations between
    3D queries and sets of input 3D geometric objects.

</ul>
<h3>Support Library</h3>

<h4>CGAL_ipelets (new package):</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Object that eases the writing of Ipe's plugins that use CGAL.
    Plugins for CGAL main 2D algorithm are provided as demo.


</ul>

<h2 id="release3.4">Release 3.4</h2>
<DIV>
<p>Release date: January 2009</p>

<p>Version 3.4 differs from version 3.3.1 in the platforms that are supported and
in functionality.  There have also been a number of bug fixes for this release.
</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li> GNU g++ 4.3 supported.  Support for g++ 3.3 is dropped.
<li> Visual 9 supported. Support for Visual 7 is dropped.

<li> Boost version 1.33 at least is now required.
<li> CGAL now depends on Boost.Threads, which implies to link against
    a compiled part of Boost.

<li> The new macro CGAL_NO_DEPRECATED_CODE can be defined to disable deprecated code,
    helping users discover if they rely on code that may be removed in
    subsequent releases.

<li> Assertion behaviour:
    It is not possible anymore to set the CONTINUE mode for assertion failures.
    Functions that allow to change the assertion behaviour are now declared in <code>&lt;CGAL/assertions_behaviour.h&gt;</code>.

<li>Qt3 based demos are still there but the documentation has been removed as the CGAL::Qt_Widget will be deprecated.

<li>Qt4 based demos use the Qt GraphicsView framework and the libQGLViewer. 
</ul>

<h3> Installation</h3>

<ul>
<li> install_cgal has been replaced by CMake.
</ul>


<h3> Polynomial  (new package)</h3>
<ul>
<li> This package introduces a concept Polynomial_d, a concept for multivariate polynomials in d variables.
</ul>


<h3>Modular Arithmetic (new package)</h3>
<ul>
<li>  This package provides arithmetic over finite fields. 
</ul>


<h3>Number Types</h3>
<ul>
<li> the counter Interval_nt::number_of_failures() has been removed, replaced by
    a profiling counter enabled with CGAL_PROFILE.


<li> Fix of a bug in CORE/Expr.h; as a consequence, the arrangement demo works properly when handling 
     arrangements of conics, for example, when defining an arc with 5 points.

</ul>



<h3>3D Spherical Geometry Kernel  (new package)</h3>
<ul>
<li> This package is an extension of the linear CGAL Kernel. It offers functionalities on spheres, 
    circles, circular arcs and line segments in the 3D space.
</ul>

<h3> Linear Kernel</h3>
<ul>
<li> We recommend that you use the object_cast() function instead of assign()
    to extract an object from a CGAL::Object, for efficiency reasons.
<li> The Kernel archetypes provided by the 2D/3D linear kernel have been removed.
<li> The deprecated linear kernel functors Construct_supporting_line_2 and
    Construct_supporting_line_3 have been removed.
<li> Ambiant_dimension and Feature_dimenison have been added to retrieve the
    potentially compile-time dimension of a space or of an object.
<li> barycenter() functions have been added.

<li> The geometric object Circle_3 as well as predicates and constructions have been added to the kernel

<li>The missing intersection/do_intersect between Line_3 and Line_3 has been added as well.
</ul>


<h3>3D Triangulations</h3>
<ul>
<li> Removed the deprecated functions Cell:mirror_index() and Cell::mirror_vertex().
<li> Derecursification of two functions that in some cases lead to stack overflows
</ul>


<h3>3D Nef Polyhedron</h3>
<ul>
<li> n-ary union/intersection
<li> intersection with halfspace under standard kernel
<li> constructor for polylines
</ul>


<h3>CGAL and the Qt4 GraphicsView (new package)</h3>
<ul>
<li> 2D CGAL Kernel objects and many data structures have can be rendered in a QGraphicsView
</ul>

<h3>STL Extensions:</h3>
<ul>
<li> The functor adaptors for argument binding and composition
    (bind_*, compose, compose_shared, swap_*, negate, along with the helper
    functions set_arity_* and Arity class and Arity_tag typedefs) which were provided
    by <code>&lt;CGAL/functional.h&gt;</code> have been removed.  Please use the better boost::bind
    mecanism instead.  The concept AdaptableFunctor has been changed accordingly
    such that only a nested result_type is required.
<li> The accessory classes Twotuple, Threetuple, Fourtuple and Sixtuple are also
    deprecated (use CGAL::array instead).
<li> CGAL::Triple and CGAL::Quadruple are in the process of being replaced by
    boost::tuple.  As a first step, we strongly recommend that you replace
    the direct access to the data members (.first, .second, .third, .fourth),
    by the get&lt;i&gt;() member function; and replace the make_triple and make_quadruple
    maker functions by make_tuple.<br>
    This way, in a further release, we will be able to switch to boost::tuple more easily.
<li> The class CGAL::Uncertain&lt;&gt; has been documented.  It is typically used to report
    uncertain results for predicates using interval arithmetic, and other filtering
    techniques.
</ul>


<h3>2D Arrangements</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Changed the name of the arrangement package from Arrangement_2 to Arrangement_on_surface_2 
    to reflect the potential capabilities of the package to construct and maintain arrangements 
    induced by curves embedded on two dimensional surfaces in three space. Most of these capabilities 
    will become available only in future releases though.
  <li> Enhanced the geometry traits concept to handle arrangements embedded on surfaces. Each geometry-traits 
    class must now define the 'Boundary_category' tag.
  <li> Fixed a bug in Arr_polyline_traits_2.h, where the operator that compares two curves failed to evaluate 
    the correct result (true) when the curves are different, but their graphs are identical.
  <li> Permanently removed IO/Arr_postscript_file_stream.h and IO/Polyline_2_postscript_file_stream.h, 
    as they depend on obsolete features and LEDA.
  <li> Fixed several bugs in the arrangement demo and enhanced it. e.g., fixed background color change, 
    allowed vertex coloring , enabled "smart" color selection, etc.
  <li> Enhanced the arrangement demo with new features, such as allowing the abortion of the merge function 
    (de-select), updated the how-to description, etc.
  <li> Replace the functions CGAL::insert_curve(), CGAL::insert_curves(), CGAL::insert_x_monotone_curve(), 
    and CGAL::insert_x_monotone_curves() with a single overloaded function CGAL::insert(). The former 
    4 functions are now deprecated, and may no longer be supported in future releases. 
</ul>

<h3>Envelopes of Surfaces in 3D</h3>

<ul>
<li> Fixed a bug in the computation of the envelope of unbounded planes caused by multiple removals 
    of vertices at infinity.
</ul>

<h3>2D Regularized Boolean Set-Operations</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Fixed a bug in connect_holes() that caused failures when connecting holes touching the outer boundary.
  <li> Fixed the concept GeneralPolygonSetTraits_2. Introduced two new concepts GpsTraitsGeneralPolygon_2 
    and GpsTraitsGeneralPolygonWithHoles_2. Fixed the definition of the two nested required types Polygon_2 
    and Polygon_with_holes_2 of the GeneralPolygonSetTraits_2 concept. They must model now the two new 
    concepts above. 
  <li> Added a default template parameter to 'General_polygon_set_2' to allow users to pass their specialized 
    DCEL used to instantiate the underlying arrangement.
  <li> Enhanced the BOP demo to use multiple windows.
</ul>

<h3>2D Minkowski Sums</h3>
<ul>
 <li> Fixed a few bugs in the approximate offset function, making it robust to highly degenerate inputs.
  <li> Fixed a bug in the exact Minkowski sum computation when processing degenerate inputs that induce overlapping 
    of contiguous segments in the convolution cycles.
  <li> Optimized the approximate offset function (reduced time consumption up to a factor of 2 in some cases).
  <li> Added functionality to compute the offset (or to approximate the offset) of a Polygon_with_holes_2 
    (and not just of a Polygon_2).
  <li> Added the functionality to compute (or to approximate) the inner offset of a polygon.
</ul>

<h2 id="release3.3">Release 3.3</h2>
<DIV>
<p>Release date: May 2007</p>

<p>
Version 3.3 differs from version 3.2.1 in the platforms that are supported and
in functionality.  There have also been a number of bug fixes for this release.
</p>

<p>Additional supported platforms
<ul>
<li> GNU g++ 4.1 and 4.2
<li> Intel C++ compiler 9
<li> Microsoft Visual C++ compiler 8.0
</ul>
	
<p>The following platforms are no longer supported:

<UL>
   <LI>Intel 8
</UL>

<p>CGAL now supports Visual C++ "Checked iterators" as well as the debug mode
of GNU g++'s STL (-D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG).</p>

<p>CGAL now works around the preprocessor macros 'min' and 'max' defined
in <code>&lt;windows.h&gt;</code> which were clashing with min/max functions.
</p>
 

<H3>Installation</H3>

<ul>
<li>On Windows the libraries built in Developer Studio now have names
  which encode the compiler version, the runtime and whether it was
  built in release or debug mode. The libraries to link against are
  chosen with linker pragmas in header files.
<li>On all platforms but Windows shared and static versions of the libraries are generated
</ul>

<h3>Manuals</h3>
<ul>
<li> The Package Overview page now also hosts the precompiled demos.
</ul>

<h3>Algebraic Foundations</h3>


<p>
<ul>
  <li>Algebraic Foundations (new package)<br>

This package defines what algebra means for CGAL, in terms of concepts, classes and functions. The main features are: (i) explicit concepts for interoperability of types (ii) separation between algebraic types (not necessarily embeddable into the reals), and number types (embeddable into the reals).

<p>
 <li>Number Types<br>
  Fixed_precision_nt and Filtered_exact number types have been removed.
</ul>

<h3>Kernels</h3>

<p>
<ul>
  <li> 2D Circular Kernel<br>
Efficiency improved through geometric filtering of predicates, introduced with 
  the filtered kernel Filtered_bbox_circular_kernel_2<.>, and also chosen for the 
  predefined kernel Exact_circular_kernel_2.

  <li> Linear Kernel<br>
 Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel memory and run-time improvements
  through usage of lazy geometric constructions instead of lazy arithmetic.
</ul>

<h3> Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Surface Mesh Simplification  (new package)<br>

  This package provides a mesh simplification framework using edge collapse
  operations, and provides the Turk/Lindstrom simplification algorithm.

<p>
<li> Skin Surface Meshing  (new package)<br>

  This package allows to build a triangular mesh of a skin surface.
    Skin surfaces are used for modeling large molecules in biological
    computing. The surface is defined by a set of balls, representing
    the atoms of the molecule, and a shrink factor that determines the
    size of the smooth patches gluing the balls together.

<p>
<li>Estimation of Local Differential Properties  (new package)<br>

  This package allows to compute local differential quantities of a surface from a point sample

<p>
<li>Approximation of Ridges and Umbilics on Triangulated Surface Meshes   (new package)<br>

  This package enables the approximation of differential features on
  triangulated surface meshes. Such curvature related features are
  lines: ridges or crests, and points: umbilics.

<p>
<li>Envelopes of Curves in 2D  (new package)<br>

  This package contains two sets of functions that construct the lower and upper envelope diagram 
  for a given range of bounded or unbounded curves.

<p>
<li>Envelopes of Surfaces in 3D  (new package)<br>

  This package contains two sets of functions that construct the lower and upper envelope diagram 
  for a given range of bounded or unbounded surfaces. The envelope diagram is realized as a 
  2D arrangement.

<p>
<li>Minkowski Sums in 2D  (new package)<br>

  This package contains functions for computing planar Minkowski sums of two closed polygons, 
  and for a polygon and a disc (an operation also known as offsetting or dilating a polygon). 
  The package also contains an efficient approximation algorithm for the offset computation, 
  which provides a guaranteed approximation bound while significantly expediting the running 
  times w.r.t. the exact computation procedure.

<p>
<li>Surface Mesh Parametrization<br>

  Added Jacobi and SSOR preconditioners to OpenNL solver, which makes it
  much faster and more stable.

<p>
<li>2D Arrangements<br>

<ul>
<li> Added support for unbounded curves.
<li> Added a traits class that supports bounded and unbounded linear objects,
  namely lines, rays and line segments.
<li> Added traits classes that handle circular arcs based on the circular kernel.
<li> Added a traits class that supports Bezier curves.
<li> Enhanced the traits class that supports rational functions to     
  handle unbounded (as well as bounded) arcs
<li> Added a free function called decompose() that produces the symbolic vertical decomposition of a 
  given arrangement, performing a batched vertical ray-shooting query from all arrangement vertices.
<li> Fixed a memory leak in the sweep-line code.
<li> Fixed a bug in computing the minor axis of non-degenerate hyperbolas.
</ul>

<li>Boolean Set Operations<br>
<ul>
<li> Added the DCEL as a default template parameter to the General_polygon_set_2 and Polygon_set_2 classes. 
  This allows users to extend the DCEL of the underlying arrangement.
<li> Added a function template called connect_holes() that connects the holes in a given polygon with holes, 
  turning it into a sequence of points, where the holes are connceted to the outer boundary using
  zero-width passages. 
<li> Added a non-const function member to General_polygon_set_2 that obtains the underlying arrangement. 
</ul>

<p>
<li>2D and 3D Triangulations<br>
<ul>
<li> The constructors and insert member functions which take an iterator range perform spatial sorting 
  in order to speed up the insertion.
</ul>


<p>
<li>Optimal Distances
<br>
<ul> 
<li>Polytope_distance_d:
  has support for homogeneous points; bugfix in fast exact version.

<DIV>
<p>Release date: May 2006</p>

<p>

in functionality.  There have also been a number of bug fixes for this release.
</p>

<p>The following platforms are no longer supported:

<UL>
   <LI>SunPro CC versions 5.4 and 5.5 on Solaris
   <LI>SGI Mips Pro 
</UL>

<p>
For Visual C++ the installation scripts choose the multi-threaded dynamically

<H3>Installation</H3>

<ul>
<li>The install tool tries to find third party libraries
   at "standard" locations.
<li> Installers for Apple, Windows, and rpms.
</ul>

<h3>Manuals</h3>
<ul>
<li> User and Reference manual pages of a package are in the same chapter 
</ul>


<h3>Kernels</h3>

<p>
<ul>
  <li> 2D Circular Kernel (new package)<br>
This package is an extension of the linear CGAL Kernel. It offers functionalities 
on circles, circular arcs and line segments in the plane.
</ul>

<h3> Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>  2D Regularized Boolean Set-Operations (new package)<br>

This package consists of the implementation of Boolean set-operations
on point sets bounded by weakly x-monotone curves in 2-dimensional
Euclidean space. In particular, it contains the implementation of
regularized Boolean set-operations, intersection predicates, and point
containment predicates.

<p>
<li> 2D Straight Skeleton and Polygon Offsetting  (new package)<br>

This package implements an algorithm to construct a halfedge data
structure representing the straight skeleton in the interior of 2D
polygons with holes and an algorithm to construct inward offset
polygons at any offset distance given a straight skeleton.


<p>
<li> 2D Voronoi Diagram Adaptor  (new package)<br>

This package provides an adaptor that adapts a
2-dimensional triangulated Delaunay graph to the corresponding
Voronoi diagram, represented as a doubly connected edge list (DCEL)
data structure. The adaptor has the ability to automatically
eliminate, in a consistent manner, degenerate features of the Voronoi
diagram, that are artifacts of the requirement that Delaunay graphs
should be triangulated even in degenerate configurations. Depending on
the type of operations that the underlying Delaunay graph supports,
the adaptor allows for the incremental or dynamic construction of
Voronoi diagrams and can support point location queries.


<p>
<li>3D Surface Mesher  (new package)<br>

This package provides functions to generate surface meshes that
interpolate smooth surfaces. The meshing algorithm is based on
Delaunay refinement and provides some guarantees on the resulting
mesh: the user is able to control the size and shape of the mesh
elements and the accuracy of the surface approximation. There is no
restriction on the topology and number of components of input
surfaces. The surface mesher may also be used for non smooth surfaces
but without guarantee.

<p>
Currently, implementations are provided for implicit surfaces
described as the zero level set of some function and surfaces
described as a gray level set in a three-dimensional image.</p>


<p>
<li> 3D Surface Subdivision Methods  (new package)<br>

Subdivision methods recursively refine a control mesh and generate
points approximating the limit surface. This package consists of four
popular subdivision methods and their refinement hosts. Supported
subdivision methods include Catmull-Clark, Loop, Doo-Sabin and sqrt(3)
subdivisions. Their respective refinement hosts are PQQ, PTQ, DQQ and
sqrt(3) refinements. Variations of those methods can be easily
extended by substituting the geometry computation of the refinement
host.


<p>
<li>  Planar Parameterization of Triangulated Surface Meshes  (new package)<br>

Parameterizing a surface amounts to finding a one-to-one mapping from
a suitable domain to the surface. In this package, we focus on
triangulated surfaces that are homeomorphic to a disk and on piecewise
linear mappings into a planar domain. This package implements some of
the state-of-the-art surface mesh parameterization methods, such as
least squares conformal maps, discrete conformal map, discrete
authalic parameterization, Floater mean value coordinates or Tutte
barycentric mapping.


<p>
<li> Principal Component Analysis  (new package)<br>

This package provides functions to compute global informations on the
shape of a set of 2D or 3D objects such as points. It provides the
computation of axis-aligned bounding boxes, centroids of point sets,
barycenters of weighted point sets, as well as linear least squares
fitting for point sets in 2D, and point sets as well as triangle sets
in 3D.


<p>
<li>2D Placement of Streamlines  (new package)<br>

Visualizing vector fields is important for many application domains. A
good way to do it is to generate streamlines that describe the flow
behaviour. This package implements the "Farthest Point Seeding"
algorithm for placing streamlines in 2D vector fields. It generates a
list of streamlines corresponding to an input flow using a specified
separating distance. The algorithm uses a Delaunay triangulation to
model objects and adress different queries, and relies on choosing the
centers of the biggest empty circles to start the integration of the
streamlines.


<p>
<li>  Kinetic Data Structures  (new package)<br>

Kinetic data structures allow combinatorial structures to be
maintained as the primitives move. The package provides
implementations of kinetic data structures for Delaunay triangulations
in two and three dimensions, sorting of points in one dimension and
regular triangulations in three dimensions. The package supports exact
or inexact operations on primitives which move along polynomial
trajectories.


<p>
<li>   Kinetic Framework  (new package)<br>

Kinetic data structures allow combinatorial geometric structures to be
maintained as the primitives move. The package provides a framework to
ease implementing and debugging kinetic data structures. The package
supports exact or inexact operations on primitives which move along
polynomial trajectories.


<p>
<li> Smallest Enclosing Ellipsoid   (new package)<br>

This algorithm is new in the chapter Geometric Optimisation.

<p>
<li>  2D Arrangement (major revision)<br>

This package can be used to construct, maintain, alter, and display
arrangements in the plane. Once an arrangement is constructed, the
package can be used to obtain results of various queries on the
arrangement, such as point location. The package also includes generic
implementations of two algorithmic frameworks, that are, computing the
zone of an arrangement, and line-sweeping the plane, the arrangements
is embedded on.

<p>
Arrangements and arrangement components can also be extended to store
additional data. An important extension stores the construction
history of the arrangement, such that it is possible to obtain the
originating curve of an arrangement subcurve.</p>


<p>
<li>   Geometric Optimisation (major revision)<br>

The underlying QP solver which is the foundation for several algorithms
in the Geometric Optimisation chapter has been completely rewritten.

<p>
<li>3D Triangulation (new functionality)<br>

Regular_triangulation_3 now offers vertex removal.

</ul>

  <LI> 3D Boolean Operations on  Nef Polyhedra (new package)<BR>
A new class (Nef_polyhedron_3) representing 3D Nef polyhedra, a
      boundary representation for cell-complexes bounded by halfspaces
      that supports boolean operations and topological operations in full
      generality including unbounded cells, mixed dimensional cells (e.g.,
      isolated vertices and antennas). Nef polyhedra distinguish between
      open and closed sets and can represent non-manifold geometry.

</LI>

<LI>  2D and Surface Function Interpolation (new package)<BR>

measures of a function on a set of discrete data points, the task is
to interpolate this function on an arbitrary query point. The package
further offers functions for natural neighbor interpolation.

</LI>

 <LI> Planar Nef polyhedra embedded on the sphere (new package)<BR>

      represent sphere neighborhoods around vertices of the three-
      dimensional Nef polyhedra.
</LI>

 <LI> Box_intersection_d (new package)<BR>

      A new efficient algorithm for finding all intersecting pairs for
      large numbers of iso-oriented boxes, i.e., typically these will be
      bounding boxes of more complicated geometries. Useful for (self-)
      intersection tests of surfaces etc.
</LI>


<LI>  2D Snap Rounding (new package)<BR>

Snap Rounding is a well known method for converting
arbitrary-precision arrangements of segments into a fixed-precision
representation. In the study of robust geometric
computing, it can be classified as a finite precision approximation
technique. Iterated Snap Roundingis a modification
of Snap Rounding in which each vertex is at least half-the-width-of-a-pixel away
from any non-incident edge. This package supports both
methods. 
</LI>

<LI>3D Triangulations

<UL>
 <LI> Triangulation_3: added operator==(),removed push_back() and copy_triangulation().
<LI> Delaunay_3 : added nearest_vertex(), move_point(), vertices_in_conflict().
<LI> Regular_3 :  added filtered traits class, and nearest_power_vertex(). 
</UL>


<LI> Planar_map and Arrangement_2

<UL>
<LI> The interface of the two traits functions that compute the intersection of two given curves changed. The functions nearest_intersection_to_right() and nearest_intersection_to_left() return an object of type CGAL::Object that represents either an empty intersection, a point, or an overlapping subcurve.
<LI> Requirements to define two binary tags were added to the traits concept of the Planar_map as follows:
<EM>Has_left_category</EM> - indicates whether the functions curves_compare_y_at_x_left() and nearest_intersection_to_left() are implemented in the traits model.
<EM>Has_reflect_category</EM> - indicates whether the functions point_reflect_in_x_and_y() and curve_reflect_in_x_and_y() are implemented in the traits model. They can be used as an alternative to the two function in the previous item.
<LI> A new constructor of the Segment_cached_2 type that represents a segment in the Arr_segment_cached_traits_2 traits class was introduced. The new constructor accepts the segment endpoints as well as the coefficients of the underlying line.
<LI> A new version of the conic-arc traits, based on CORE version 1.7 was introduced. This new traits class makes use of CORE's rootOf() operator to compute the intersection points in the arrangement, making its code much simpler and more elegant than the previous version. In addition, new constructors for conic arcs are provided. The new traits class usually performs about 30% faster than the version included in CGAL 3.0
<LI> The traits class that handles continuous piecewise linear curves, namely Arr_polyline_traits_2, was rewritten. The new class is parametrized with a traits class that handles segments, say Segment_traits. The polyline curve defined within the Arr_polyline_traits_2 class is implemented as a vector of segments of type Segment_traits::Curve_2.
<LI> A meta traits class, namely Arr_curve_data_traits_2,  that extends the curve type of the planar-map with arbitrary additional data was introduced. It should be instantiated with a regular traits-class and a class that contains all extraneous data associated with a curve.
<LI>  The class that represents the trapezoidal-decomposition point location strategy was renamed to Pm_trapezoid_ric_point_location.
<LI> The Arrangement demo was rewritten. It covers many more features, has a much better graphical user interface, and comes with online documentation.
<LI> Few bugs in the sweep-line module related to overlapping vertical segments were fixed. This module is used by the aggregate insert method that inserts a collection of curves at once.
</UL>


<LI>Triangulation_2

<UL>
<LI> added a filtered trait class in the regular triangulation
<LI> added split and join operations in the triangulation data structure class
</UL>

<LI>Alpha_shapes_3

<UL>
<LI>major changes in the implementation of the class Alpha_shapes_3.
<LI>New implementation results in a true GENERAL mode
    allowing null and negative alpha-values. It also fixed the edges classification bug
    and introduces a classification of vertices.

<LI> Internal code cleanup; in particular, implementation details
  don't pollute the namespace CGAL anymore

<H3>Basic Library</H3>

<UL>
  <LI> 2D Apollonius Graph (new package)<BR>
Algorithms for computing the Apollonius
      graph in two dimensions.  The Apollonius graph is the dual of the
      Apollonius diagram, also known as the additively weighted Voronoi
      diagram.  The latter can be thought of as the Voronoi diagram of a set
      of circles under the Euclidean metric, and it is a generalization of the
      standard Voronoi diagram for points.  The algorithms provided are
      dynamic.

  <LI>dD Min Sphere of Spheres (new package)<BR>
      Algorithms to compute the smallest
      enclosing sphere of a given set of spheres in R<sup>d</sup>.  
      The package provides
      an algorithm with maximal expected running time 
      <i>O(2<sup>O(d)</sup> n)</i> and a
      fast and robust heuristic (for dimension less than 30).

<LI>Spatial Searching (new package)<BR>

 <LI><B>Kd-tree</b><br>
this package is deprecated, its documentation is removed.
      It is replaced by the Spatial Searching package.

  <LI>Largest_empty_rectangle_2<BR>
       Given a set of points P in the plane, the class
       Largest_empty_iso_rectangle_2 is a data structure that
       maintains an iso-rectangle with the largest area among all
       iso-rectangles that are inside a given iso-rectangle bounding box,
       and that do not contain any point of the point set P.

<LI> 2D Triangulation and 
     3D Triangulation<BR>
     <UL>
      <LI> The classes Triangulation_data_structure_2 (and 3), which implements
        the data structure for 2D triangulation class, now makes use of
        CGAL::Compact_container (see Support Library section below).
      <LI> The triangulation classes use a Rebind mecanism to provide
        the full flexibility on Vertex and Face base classes.
        This means that it is possible for the user to derive its own Face
        of Vertex base class, adding a functionality that makes use of
        types defined by the triangulation data structure like Face_handle
        or Vertex_handle.
      <LI> New classes Triangulation_vertex_base_with_info_2 (and 3) and
	Triangulation_face_base_with_info_2 (and 3) to make easier the
        customisation of base classes in most cases.
     </UL>

<LI> 2D Triangulation<BR>
     <UL>
      <LI> Regular triangulation provides an easy access to hidden points.
      <LI> The Triangulation_hierarchy_2, which provide an efficient location
	data structure, can now be used with any 2D triangulation class plugged
        in (including Regular triangulations).
      </ul>

<LI> 3D Triangulation<BR>
     <UL>
     <LI> faster vertex removal function in Delaunay_triangulation_3.
      <LI> Delaunay_triangulation_3 is now independent of the order of insertions
        of the points (in case of degenerate cosphericity).
      <LI>Regular_triangulation_3 now hides vertices (and updates itself) when
        inserting a coinciding point with greater weight.  This required a new
        predicate.
      <LI> deprecated functions: copy_triangulation(), push_back(),
        set_number_of_vertices().
      <LI> Triangulation_3 now gives non-const access to the data structure.
     </UL>

<LI> Interval Skip List (new package)<BR>
An interval skip list is a data strucure for finding all intervals 
      that contain a point, and for stabbing queries, that is for answering 
      the question whether a given point is contained in an interval or not. 

<LI> 
       Planar Maps and
       
       Arrangements<BR>

 The changes concern mainly the traits classes.
      <OL>
        <LI> New traits hierarchy and interface:
           The set of requirements was made sound and complete. A couple of
	   requirements were eliminated, few others were redefined, and some
	   were renamed. A hierarchy of three traits classes for the
	   Planar_map_2, Planar_map_with_intersections_2, and Arrangement_2
	   types was established to include only the necessary requirements at
           each level. It was determined that for the aggregate insertion-
	   operation based on a sweep-line algorithm only a subset of the
	   requirements is needed. Preconditions were added where appropriate
	   to tighten the requirements further.

           The following functions have been renamed:
           <UL>
           <LI> point_is_same() renamed to point_equal()
           <LI> curve_is_same() renamed to curve_equal()
           <LI> curve_is_in_x_range() renamed to point_in_x_range()
           <LI> curve_compare_at_x() renamed to curves_compare_y_at_x()
             Furthermore, a precondition has been added that the reference
	     point is in the x-range of both curves.
           <LI> curve_compare_at_x_right() renamed to
	     curves_compare_y_at_x_to_right().
             Furthermore, a precondition has been added that both curves are
	     equal at the reference point and defined to its right.
           <LI> curve_compare_at_x_left() renamed to
	     curves_compare_y_at_x_to_left().
             Furthermore, a precondition has been added that both curves are
	     equal at the reference point and defined to its right.
           <LI> curve_get_point_status() renamed to curve_compare_y_at_x().
             Furthermore, a precondition has been added that the point is in
	     the x-range of the curve. Consequently, the function now returns a
	     Comparison_result (instead of a special enum).
           <LI> make_x_monotone() renamed to curve_make_x_monotone()
             See more details below.
           <LI> curve_flip() renamed to curve_opposite()
           </UL>

           The following functions have been removed:
           <UL>
           <LI> curve_is_between_cw()
           <LI> point_to_left()
           <LI> point_to_right()
           <LI> is_x_monotone()
           <LI> point_reflect_in_x_and_y()
           <LI> curve_reflect_in_x_and_y()
           <LI> do_intersect_to_right()
           <LI> do_intersect_to_left()
           </ul>

           Most functions, are required by the PlanarMapTraits_2 concept,
	   except for the make_x_monotone(), nearest_intersection_to_right(),
           nearest_intersection_to_left(), curves_overlap() and
	   curve_opposite(). PlanarMapWithIntersectionsTraits_2 requires all
	   these functions, except curve_opposite(), needed only by the
	   ArrangementTraits_2 concept.
           <p>
           Furthermore, the two functions curve_compare_at_x_left() and
           nearest_intersection_to_left() can be omitted, if the two functions
	   point_reflect_in_x() and curve_reflect_in_x() are implemented.
	   Reflection can be avoided, if the two _left functions are supplied.

        <LI> The type X_curve_2 of the PlanarMapWithIntersectionsTraits_2
           concept was renamed to X_monotone_curve_2, and the distinction
	   between this type and the Curve_2 type was made firm. The method
	   is_x_monotone() of the PlanarMapWithIntersectionsTraits_2 concept
	   was removed. The related method curve_make_x_monotone() is now
	   called for each input curve of type Curve_2 when curves are inserted
           into a Planar_map_with_intersections_2 to subdivide the input curve
	   into x-monotone sub-curves (and in case the curve is already
	   x-monotone, this function is responsible for casting it to an
	   x-monotone curve).

        <LI> New and improved traits classes:
           <LI> Conic traits - Arr_conic_traits_2
             Support finite segments of ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas, as
	     well as line segments. The traits require an exact real number-
	     type, such as leda_real or CORE::Expr.

           <LI> Segment cached traits - Arr_segment_cached_traits_2
	     This class uses an improved representation for segments that helps
	     avoiding cascaded computations, thus achieving faster running
	     times. To work properly, an exact rational number-type should be
	     used.

           <LI> Polyline traits - Arr_polyline_traits_2
             The polyline traits class has been reimplemented to work in a more
	     efficient, generic manner. The new class replaces the obsolete
	     Arr_polyline_traits class. It is parameterized with a segment
	     traits class.

           <LI> Hyperbola and segment traits - Arr_hyper_segment_traits_2
             Supports line segments and segments of canonical hyperbolas.
	     This is the type of curves that arise when projecting segments
	     in three-space rotationally around a line onto a plane containing
	     the line. Such projections are often useful in CAD/CAM problems.

        <LI> Removed old traits class:
           <UL>
            <LI> The models of the PlanarMapWithIntersectionsTraits_2 concept
	      below became obsolete, as the new conic traits, namely
	      Arr_conic_traits_2, supports the same functionality and is much
	      more efficient.
              <UL>
                <LI> Arr_circles_real_traits
                <LI> Arr_segment_circle_traits
              </UL>
           <LI> The segment traits class and the new polyline traits class were
	      reimplemented using standard CGAL-kernel calls. This essentially
	      eliminated the corresponding leda traits classes, namely:
              <UL>
                <LI> Pm_leda_segment_traits_2
                <LI> Arr_leda_segment_traits_2
                <LI> Arr_leda_polyline_traits
              </UL>
              With the use of the Leda_rat_kernel new external package the same
	      functionality can be achieved with less overhead and more
	      efficiency.
      </UL>

<LI> Sweep Line<BR>
      <UL>
       <LI> The Sweep_line_2 package was reimplemented. As a consequence it is much
        more efficient, its traits is tighter (namely neither the two _left nor
	the reflection functions are required), and its interface has changed a
	bit.
        <OL>
          <LI> The following global functions have been removed:
            <UL>
             <LI> sweep_to_produce_subcurves_2()
             <LI> sweep_to_produce_points_2()
             <LI> sweep_to_construct_planar_map_2()
            </UL>
           Instead, the public methods of the Sweep_line_2 class listed below
	   were introduced:
           <UL>
             <LI> get_subcurves() - Given a container of curves, this function
	     returns a list of curves that are created by intersecting the
	     input curves.

             <LI> get_intersection_points() - Given a range of curves, this function
	     returns a list of points that are the intersection points of the
	     curves.

             <LI> get_intersecting_curves() - Given a range of curves, this function
	     returns an iterator to the beginning of a range that contains the
	     list of curves for each intersection point between any two curves
	     in the specified range.
           </UL>
        <LI> It is possible to construct a planar map with intersections (or an
	   arrangement) by inserting a range of curves into an empty map. This
	   will invoke the sweep-line process to construct the map more
	   efficiently.
       </OL>
      <LI> New interface functions to the Planar_map_with_intersections_2 class.
        The Planar_map_with_intersections_2 class maintains a planar map of
	input curves that possibly intersect each other and are not necessarily
	x-monotone. If an input curve, or a set of input curves, are known to
	be x-monotone and pairwise disjoint, the new functions below can be
	used to insert them into the map efficiently.
       </UL>

              <tt>ABSOLUTE_INDEXING</tt>, and <tt>RELATIVE</tt> to
              <tt>RELATIVE_INDEXING</tt> to avoid conflicts with similarly 
              named macros of another library.
	  <LI>Changed member functions <tt>add_vertex()</tt>, 
              <tt>begin_facet()</tt>, and <tt>end_facet()</tt> to return 
              useful handles.
          <LI>Added <tt>test_facet()</tt> to check facets for validity 
              before adding them.

<H3>Support Library</H3>

<ul>
    <li> New container class Compact_container, which (roughly) provides the
      flexibility of std::list, with the memory compactness of std::vector.

    <li> Geomview_stream: added a function
      gv.draw_triangles(InputIterator begin, InputIterator end)
      which draws a set of triangles much more quickly than one by one.

    <li> Number types:
      <ul>
      <li> number types are now required to provide a function:
        std::pair&lt;double, double&gt;  to_interval(const NT &amp;).
      <li> number types are now required to provide mixed operators with "int".
      <li> CLN support removed.
      <li> faster square() for MP_Float.
      <li> added Gmp_q.

    <li> Qt_widget:
      <ul>
       <li> New classes:
        <ul>
	<li> Qt_help_window: provides a simple way to show some helpful
	  information about a demo as an HTML page.
	<li> Qt_widget_history: provides basic functionality to manipulate
	  intervals of Qt_widget class. The current visible area of Qt_widget
          is mapped to an interval. Each interval could be stored in the
	  Qt_widget_history object. So you can use this object to navigate in
          history.  It is mostly used by Qt_widget_standard_toolbar.
         </ul>
      <li> Changes:
        <ul>
	<li> Qt_widget_standard_toolbar: is derived from QToolBar class, so pay
	  attention to modify your code, if you used this class. Some public
	  methods were introduced to control the history object that the
          toolbar use to navigate.
	<li> the icons are now part of libCGALQt.
        </ul>
      <li> Deprecated members of Qt_widget:
        <ul>
        <li> add_to_history(), clear_history(), back(), forth(): use forward(),
          back() and clear_history() of the Qt_widget_standard_toolbar instead.
        <li> custom_redraw(): use redraw_on_back() and redraw_on_front() instead.
         </ul>
      <li> Optimizations:
        the output operators of the following classes have been optimized:
        <ul>
        <li> CGAL::Segment_2  (now tests for intersection with the drawing area)
        <li> CGAL::Triangle_2 (now tests for intersection with the drawing area)
        <li> CGAL::Triangulation_2 (is optimized for faster display on zooming)
        </ul>

<H3>Known problems</H3>
<UL>
<LI> 2D Nef Polyhedra contains a memory leak.  Memory problems are also
     the likely cause of occasional run-time errors on some platforms.
<LI> The d-dimensional convex hull computation produces run-time errors on
     some platforms because of memory management bugs.
<LI> The new Halfedge Data Structure design introduced with release 2.3
     does not work on VC6.  See the release notes in the manual for more
     information.
<LI> The following deficiencies relate to planar maps, planar maps of
     intersecting curves (pmwx), arrangements and sweep line.
   <UL>
    <LI> On KCC, Borland and SunPro we guarantee neither compilation nor 
         correct execution for all of the packages above.
    <LI> On VC6 and VC7 we guarantee neither compilation nor correct
         execution of the sweep line package.
    <LI> On CC (on Irix 6.5) the trapezoidal decomposition point location
         strategy is problematic when used with planar maps, pmwx, or
         arrangements (mind that this is the default for planar maps).
    <LI> On CC (on Irix 6.5) sweep line with polyline traits does not compile
         (mind that the so-called leda polyline traits does compile).
    <LI> On g++ (on Irix 6.5) the segment-circle (Arr_segment_circle_traits_2)
         traits does not compile for either of the above packages.

in functionality.</p>

<P>
Additional supported platform:

<UL>
   <LI> Gnu g++ 3.0 on Solaris and Linux 
</UL>

<p>
The following functionality has been added:<BR><BR>

<H3>Kernels</H3>
<UL>
<LI> The 2D and 3D kernels now serve as models of the new kernel concept
     described in the recent paper, "An Adaptable and Extensible Geometry
     Kernel" by Susan Hert, Micheal Hoffmann, Lutz Kettner, Sylvain Pion,
     and Michael Seel to be presented at 
     WAE 2001 (and 
     soon available as a technical report).  This new kernel is
     completely compatible with the previous design but is more flexible
     in that it allows geometric predicates as well as objects to be easily
     exchanged and adapted individually to users' needs.

<LI> A new kernel called <TT>Simple_homogeneous</TT> is available. It is 
     equivalent to <TT>Homogeneous</TT> but without reference-counted objects.

<LI> A new kernel called <TT>Filtered_kernel</TT> is available that allows 
     one to build kernel traits classes that use exact and efficient predicates.

<LI> There are two classes, <TT>Cartesian_converter</TT> and 
     <TT>Homogeneous_converter</TT>
     that allows one to convert objects between different Cartesian and
     homogeneous kernels, respectively.

<LI> A new d-dimensional kernel, <TT>Kernel_d</TT> is available.  It provides 
     diverse kernel objects, predicates and constructions in d dimensions with 
     two representations based on the kernel families <TT>Cartesean_d</TT> and 
     <TT>Homogeneous_d</TT>
</UL>

<H3>Basic Library</H3>
   Almost all packages in the basic library have been adapted to the
   new kernel design to realize the flexibility this design makes possible.
   In several packages, this means that the traits class requirements have
   changed to conform to the function objects offered in the kernels so the
   kernels themselves can be used as traits classes in many instances.

<UL>
<LI>
    2D Convex Hull<BR>
    The traits requirements have changed slightly to bring them in line with

    3D Convex Hull
<UL>
  <LI> The function <TT>convex_hull_3</TT> now uses a new implementation of the
       quickhull algorithm and no longer requires LEDA.
  <LI> A new <TT>convex_hull_incremental_3</TT> function based on the new

<LI> 
     Polygons and Polygon Operations<BR>
     <UL>
       <LI> The traits class requirements have been changed.
       <LI> The simplicity test has a completely new implementation.
       <LI> Properties like convexity, simplicity and area can now be cached by
            polygons. You need to set a flag to select this behaviour.
     </UL>

     <BR><BR>
<LI> 
     Planar Nef Polyhedra<BR>
     A new class (<TT>Nef_polyhedron_2</TT>) representing planar Nef polyhedra =
     rectilinearly bounded points sets that are the result of binary and
     topological operations starting from halfplanes.

     <BR><BR>
<LI> A new package offering functions to 
     
     partition planar polygons into
     convex and y-monotone pieces is available.

     <BR><BR>
<LI> 
     Planar Maps and 
     
     Arrangements
     <UL>
     <LI> A new class <TT>Planar_map_with_intersections_2&lt;Planar_map&gt;</TT> for 
          planar maps of possibly intersecting, possibly non-x-monotone, 
          possibly overlapping curves (like <TT>Arrangement_2</TT> but without 
          the hierarchy tree).

     <LI> I/O utilities for planar maps and arrangements for textual and
          graphical streams. (It is possible to save and later reload built
          planar maps or arrangements.)

     <LI> New arrangement traits class for line segments and circular arcs
          (<TT>Arr_segment_circle_traits&lt;NT&gt;</TT>).

     <LI> New faster traits for polylines specialized for using the LEDA
          rational kernel (<TT>Arr_leda_polylines_traits</TT>). The LEDA 
          traits for segments was also made faster.

     <LI> A new point location strategy 
          (<TT>Pm_simple_point_location&lt;Planar_map&gt;</TT>).
     </UL>
     <BR><BR>

<LI> 
     Halfedge Data Structure<BR><BR>

     The halfedge data structure has been completely revised. The new design
     is more in line with the STL naming scheme and it provides a safe and
     coherent type system throughout the whole design (no void* pointers
     anymore), which allows for better extendibility. A user can add new
     incidences in the mesh easily. The new design also uses standard
     allocators with a new template parameter that has a suitable default.
     <BR><BR>

     The old design is still available, but its use is deprecated, see the
     manual of
     deprecated packages for its documentation. Reported bugs in
     copying the halfedge data structure (and therefore also polyhedral
     surfaces) have been fixed in both designs. Copying a list-based
     representation is now based on hash maps instead of std::map and is
     therefore considerably faster.

     <BR><BR>
<LI>  
      Polyhedral Surface

     <BR><BR>
     The polyhedral surface has been rewritten to work with the new
     halfedge data structure design. The user level interface of the
     <TT>CGAL::Polyhedron_3</TT> class is almost backwards compatible with the
     previous class. The exceptions are the template parameter list,
     everything that relies on the flexibility of the underlying
     halfedge data structure, such as a self-written facet class, and
     that the distinction between supported normals and supported planes
     has been removed. Only planes are supported. See the manuals for
     suggestions how to handle normals instead of planes.

     <BR><BR>
     More example programs are provided with polyhedral surfaces,
     for example, one about Euler operator and one computing a subdivision
     surface given a control mesh as input.

     <BR><BR>
     The old design is still available for backwards compatibility and to
     support older compiler, such as MSVC++6.0. For the polyhedral surface,
     old and new design cannot be used simultaneously (they have identical
     include file names and class names). The include files select
     automatically the old design for MSVC++6.0 and the new design
     otherwise. This automatism can be overwritten by defining appropriate
     macros before the include files. The old design is selected with the
     <TT>CGAL_USE_POLYHEDRON_DESIGN_ONE</TT> macro. The new design is selected 
     with the <TT>CGAL_USE_POLYHEDRON_DESIGN_TWO</TT> macro.

<LI> 
     2D Triangulation
     <UL>
     <LI> The geometric traits class requirements have been changed to conform
          to the new CGAL kernels.  CGAL kernel classes can be used as traits
          classes for all 2D triangulations except for regular triangulations.

     <LI> As an alternative to the simple insert() member function,
          insertion of points in those triangulation can be performed using the
          combination of find_conflicts() and star_hole() which eventually
          allows the user to keep track of deleted faces.

<h2 id="release2.2">Release 2.2</h2>
<DIV>
<p>Release date: October 2000</p>

<p>Version 2.2 differs from version 2.1 in the platforms that are supported and
in functionality.</p>

<P>
Additional supported platforms:

<UL>
   <LI> the KAI compiler (4.0) on Solaris 5.8
   <LI> Borland C++ (5.5)
</UL>

<p>
The following functionality has been added:

<UL>
<LI> There is a new, non-reference-counted kernel, Simple_cartesian. Because
     reference counting is not used, and thus coordinates are stored within a
     class, debugging is easier using this kernel.  This kernel can also be
     faster in some cases than the reference-counted Cartesian kernel.

<LI> New optimisation algorithms
     <UL>
        <LI> Min_annulus_d - Algorithm for computing the smallest enclosing 
             annulus of points in arbitrary dimension
        <LI> Polytope_distance_d - Algorithm for computing the (squared) 
             distance between two convex polytopes in arbitrary dimension
        <LI> Width_3 - Algorithm for computing the (squared) width of points 
             sets in three dimensions
     </UL>

<LI> 2D Triangulations
     <UL>
       <LI> There are now two triangulation data structures available in CGAL.
            The new one uses a list to store the faces and allows one to 
            represent two-dimensional triangulations embedded in three spaces 
            as well as planar triangulations.
       <LI> The triangulation hierarchy which allows fast location query
            is now available.
     </UL>

<LI> Inifinite objects can now be included in planar maps.

<LI> Removal as well as insertions of vertices for 3D Delaunay triangulations 
     is now possible.

<LI> A generator for ``random'' simple polygons is now available.

<LI> In directory demo/Robustness, programs that demonstrate typical robustness
     problems in geometric computing are presented along with the solutions to
     these problems that CGAL provides.
</UL>

<P>
The following functionality has been removed:
<UL>
  <LI> The binary operations on polygons (union, intersection ...) have been 
       removed.  Those operations were not documented in the previous release 
       (2.1).  Arrangements can often be used as a substitute.
</UL>
</DIV>


<h2  id="release2.1">Release 2.1</h2>

<DIV>
<p>Release date: January 2000</p>

<p>Version 2.1 differs from version 2.0 in the platforms that are supported and
in functionality.</p>

<p>
Supported platforms:

<UL>
   <LI> the newest gnu compiler (2.95.2) on Sun, SGI, Linux and Windows.
   <LI> the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, version 6.
   <LI> the mips CC compiler version 7.3 under Irix.
</UL>

Support for the old g++ compiler (2.8) and for mips CC 7.2 has been dropped.

<BR><BR>
The following functionality has been added:

<UL>
<LI> Alpha shapes and weighted alpha shapes in 2D. Alpha shapes are a
     generalization of the convex hull of a point set.
<LI> Arrangements in 2D. Arrangements are related to and based on planar maps.
     The major difference between the two is that curves are allowed to 
     intersect in the case of arrangements.
<LI> Extensions to triangulations in 2D.  Constrained triangulations are now 
     dynamic: they support insertions of new constraint as well as removal of 
     existing constraints.  There are also constrained Delaunay triangulations.
<LI> Triangulations in 3D were added, both Delaunay triangulations and regular
     triangulations.
<LI> Min_quadrilateral optimisations have been added.  These are algorithms to 
     compute the minimum enclosing rectangle/parallelogram (arbitrary 
     orientation) and the minimum enclosing strip of a convex point set. 
<LI> 2d Point_set is a package for 2d range search operations, Delaunay
     triangulation, nearest neighbor queries. This package works only if 
     LEDA
     is installed.
<LI> Support for GeoWin visualization library. This also depends on
     LEDA.
<LI> Support for using the
     CLN number type
     together with CGAL.
