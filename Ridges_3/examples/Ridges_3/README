Program Compute_Ridges_Umbilics
-----------------
takes a polyhedron (filename.off file) as input,
it computes a jet fitting to set the monge data at each vertex 
   computes the ridge lines and the umbilics

it outputs the results in :
1. filename.offRIDGES-d?-m?-t?-a?-p?.4ogl.txt  which stores raw data to be used for a nonprovided further processing (visualization for instance, the interested user may want to build on top of the polyhedron package demo)
2. if option -vtrue, filename.offRIDGES-d?-m?-t?-a?-p?.verb.txt contains human readable results


Allowed options:

                                                       file


Note : if the nb of collected points is less than the required min number of 
   points to make the approximation possible (which is constrained by the deg)
   then the program exits.
