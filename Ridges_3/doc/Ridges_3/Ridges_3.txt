This chapter describes the \cgal package for the approximating the
ridges and umbilics of a smooth surface discretized by a triangle
mesh. Given a smooth surface, a ridge is a curve along which one of
the principal curvatures has an extremum along its curvature line. An
umbilic is a point at which both principal curvatures are
equal. Ridges define a singular curve, i.e., a self-intersecting
curve, and umbilics are special points on this curve. Ridges are
curves of <I>extremal</I> curvature and therefore encode important
informations used in segmentation, registration, matching and surface
analysis. Based on the results of the article
\cgalCite{cgal:cp-tdare-05}, we propose algorithms to identify and extract
different parts of this singular ridge curve as well as umbilics on a
surface given as a triangulated surface mesh. Differential quantities
associated to the mesh vertices are assumed to be given for these
algorithms; such quantities may be computed by the package \ref PkgJetFitting3.


Note that this package needs the third party library \ref thirdpartyEigen for linear algebra operations.

\section Ridges_3Overview Overview

Section \ref smooth presents the basics of the theory of ridges and
umbilics on smooth surfaces. Sections \ref Ridges_3Approximating and
\ref Ridges_3Approximating_1 present algorithms for approximating the ridges and
umbilics (of a smooth surface) from a triangle mesh. Section
\ref Ridges_3Software gives the package specifications, while example calls to
functions of the package are provided in Section \ref Ridges_3Examples.

\section smooth Ridges and Umbilics of a Smooth Surface

For a detailed introduction to ridges and related topics, the reader
may consult
\cgalCite{cgal:hgygm-ttdpf-99}, as well as
the survey article \cgalCite{cgal:cp-ssulc-05}.
In the sequel, we just introduce the basic notions so as to explain
our algorithms. Consider a smooth embedded surface, and denote \f$ k_1\f$
and \f$ k_2\f$ the principal curvatures, with \f$ k_1\geq k_2\f$. Umbilics are
the points where \f$ k_1=k_2\f$. For any non umbilical point, the
corresponding principal directions of curvature are well defined, and
we denote them \f$ d_1\f$ and \f$ d_2\f$.
In local coordinates, we denote \f$ \langle , \rangle\f$ the inner product
induced by the ambient Euclidean space, and \f$ dk_1\f$, \f$ dk_2\f$ the
gradients of the principal curvatures. Ridges, illustrated in
\cgalFigureRef{ellipsoidridges} for the standard ellipsoid, are defined by:

<B>Definition.</B> \anchor defridgeextrema
A non umbilical point is called
<UL>
<LI>a max ridge point, if the <I>extremality coefficient</I> \f$ b_0=\langle
dk_1,d_1 \rangle\f$ vanishes, i.e.\ \f$ b_0=0\f$.

<LI>a min ridge point, if the <I>extremality coefficient</I>
\f$ b_3=\langle dk_2,d_2 \rangle\f$ vanishes, i.e.\ \f$ b_3=0\f$
\cgalFootnote{Notations \f$ b_0, b_3\f$ comes from Equation \ref eqmonge }.
</UL>

The previous characterization of ridges involves third-order
differential properties. Using fourth-order differential quantities, a
ridge point can further be qualified as <I>elliptic</I> if it
corresponds to a maximum of \f$ k_1\f$ or a minimum of \f$ k_2\f$, or <I>hyperbolic</I> otherwise. Hence we end up with four types of ridges, namely:
\ref MAX_ELLIPTIC_RIDGE, \ref MAX_HYPERBOLIC_RIDGE, \ref MIN_ELLIPTIC_RIDGE,
\ref MIN_HYPERBOLIC_RIDGE, which are illustrated in \cgalFigureRef{ellipsoidridges}.
Also of interest are the <I>crest lines</I>, a crest line being an
elliptic ridge which is a maximum of \f$ \max(|k_1|,|k_2|)\f$. Crest lines
form a subset of elliptic ridges, and can be seen as the visually most
salient curves on a surface.
Hence we provide the two additional ridge types
\ref MAX_CREST_RIDGE and \ref MIN_CREST_RIDGE, which are illustrated in
\cgalFigureRef{davidcrest}.

\ref MAX_ELLIPTIC_RIDGE are blue, \ref MAX_HYPERBOLIC_RIDGE are green,
\ref MIN_ELLIPTIC_RIDGE are red and \ref MIN_HYPERBOLIC_RIDGE are
yellow. The red line is also the \ref MIN_CREST_RIDGE and this is the
only crest ridge of the ellipsoid.
\cgalFigureEnd

At any point of the surface which is not an umbilic, principal
directions \f$ d_1, d_2\f$ are well defined, and these (non oriented)
directions together with the normal vector \f$ n\f$ define two direct
orthonormal frames. If \f$ v_1\f$ is a unit vector of direction \f$ d_1\f$ then
there exists a unique unit vector \f$ v_2\f$ so that \f$ (v_1,v_2,n)\f$ is
direct, that is has the same orientation as the canonical basis of the
ambient \f$ 3d\f$ space (and the other possible frame is \f$ (-v_1,-v_2,n)\f$). In the
coordinate systems \f$ (v_1,v_2,n)\f$, the surface has the following
canonical form, known as the Monge form :

\anchor eqmonge
\f{eqnarray}{
z(x,y) = & \frac{1}{2}(k_1x^2 + k_2y^2)+
\frac{1}{6}(b_0x^3+3b_1x^2y+3b_2xy^2+b_3y^3) \\
& +\frac{1}{24}(c_0x^4+4c_1x^3y+6c_2x^2y^2+4c_3xy^3+c_4y^4) + h.o.t
\f}

The Taylor expansion of \f$ k_1\f$ (resp. \f$ k_2\f$) along the max
(resp. min) curvature line going through the origin and parameterized
by \f$ x\f$ (resp. \f$ y\f$) are:

\anchor eqtaylor_along_line
\f{equation}{
k_1(x) = k_1 + b_0x + \frac{P_1}{2(k_1-k_2)}x^2 + ... , \quad \quad \quad
P_1= 3b_1^2+(k_1-k_2)(c_0-3k_1^3).
\f}

\anchor eqtaylor_along_red_line
\f{equation}{
k_2(y) = k_2 + b_3y + \frac{P_2}{2(k_2-k_1)}y^2 + ... , \quad \quad \quad
P_2= 3b_2^2+(k_2-k_1)(c_4-3k_2^3).
\f}

Notice also that switching from one to the other of the two
afore-mentioned coordinate systems reverts the sign of all the odd
coefficients on the Monge form of the surface.<BR>

<BR>

Hence ridge types are characterized by
<UL>
<LI>max ridge if \f$ b_0=0\f$
<LI>\ref MAX_ELLIPTIC_RIDGE if \f$ b_0=0\f$ and \f$ P_1<0\f$
<LI>\ref MAX_HYPERBOLIC_RIDGE if \f$ b_0=0\f$ and \f$ P_1>0\f$
<LI>min ridge if \f$ b_3=0\f$
<LI>\ref MIN_ELLIPTIC_RIDGE if \f$ b_3=0\f$ and \f$ P_2<0\f$
<LI>\ref MIN_HYPERBOLIC_RIDGE if \f$ b_3=0\f$ and \f$ P_2>0\f$
<LI>\ref MAX_CREST_RIDGE if \f$ b_0=0\f$ and \f$ P_1<0\f$ and \f$ |k_1|>|k_2|\f$
<LI>\ref MIN_CREST_RIDGE if \f$ b_3=0\f$ and \f$ P_2<0\f$ and \f$ |k_2|>|k_1|\f$
</UL>

As illustrated in \cgalFigureRef{index_umbilic} and \cgalFigureRef{umbilics}, the
patterns made by curvature lines around an umbilic can be
characterized using the notion of an <I>index</I> associated to the
principal directions - see also \cgalCite{cgal:cp-ssulc-05}.
As depicted in \cgalFigureRef{index_umbilic}, consider a small circuit \f$ C\f$ around the
umbilic, and a point \f$ p \in C\f$. Starting from an initial orientation
\f$ u\f$ of a tangent vector to the curvature line through point \f$ p\f$,
propagate <I>by continuity</I> this orientation around the circuit. The
index is defined by the angle swept by \f$ u\f$ around this revolution,
normalized by \f$ 2\pi\f$. In our example, the index is thus 1/2.

If the index of the principal direction field is \f$ 1/2\f$
then it is called a
\ref ELLIPTIC_UMBILIC, if it is \f$ -1/2\f$ it is called a \ref HYPERBOLIC_UMBILIC.
Otherwise the umbilic is qualified
\ref NON_GENERIC_UMBILIC.

\section Ridges_3Approximating Approximating Ridges on Triangulated Surface Meshes

Our method aims at reporting ridges as polygonal lines living on the
mesh. It assumes differential quantities are available for each vertex
of the mesh (principal curvatures and directions together with third
order quantities \f$ b_0, b_3\f$ and optionally fourth order quantities
\f$ P_1, P_2\f$). These differential quantities may be computed for the
smooth surface the mesh is inscribed in (analytically or using
approximation methods), or may be estimated for a mesh given without
reference to an underlying smooth surface. Although the ridge
approximation algorithm is the same in both cases, one cannot ambition
to ask for the same certificates. This distinction calls for the
notion of <I>compliant</I> mesh.

<b>Compliant meshes.</b>

Ridges of a smooth surface are points with prescribed differential
properties, and reporting them from a mesh inscribed in the surface
requires delicate hypothesis on the geometry of that mesh so as to get
a certified result. In this paragraph, we assume the mesh provided
complies with a number of hypothesis, which guarantee the topology of
the ridges reported matches that of the ridges on the smooth
surface. To summarize things, a compliant mesh is a mesh dense enough
so that (i) umbilics are properly isolated (ii) ridges running next
to one another are also properly separated.
See \cgalCite{cgal:cp-tdare-05} for a detailed discussion of <I>compliant</I> meshes.<BR>

As 0-level set of the extremality coefficients \f$ b_0\f$ and \f$ b_3\f$, ridges
are extracted by a marching triangles algorithm.\cgalFootnote{A marching triangles algorithm is similar to a 2d marching cubes algorithm (or marching rectangles algorithm), except that a one-manifold is reported on a two-manifold tessellated by triangles.}

As the signs of these extremality coefficients depend on the
orientation of the principal directions, we expect both extremalities
and vectors orienting the principal direction to be given at each
point vertex of the mesh. Except in the neighborhood of umbilics, if
the mesh is dense enough, a coherent orientation of principal
directions at both endpoints of an edge is chosen such that the angle
between the two vectors is acute. This rule, the <I>acute rule</I>, is
precisely analyzed in \cgalCite{cgal:cp-tdare-05}.
Moreover, we only seek ridges in triangles for which one can find an
orientation of its three vertices such that the three edges are
coherently oriented by the acute rule. Such triangles are called
<I>regular</I>. This said, two remarks are in order.

<I> - Regular triangles and ridge segments.</I>
A regular triangle has 0 or 2 edges crossed by a max (resp. min)
ridge, which is tantamount to a sign change of \f$ b_0\f$ (resp. \f$ b_3\f$)
along the corresponding edges. In the latter case, we say that the
triangle contains a ridge segment.
Two methods are provided to compute its type, be it elliptic or
hyperbolic. First, if fourth order differential quantities are
provided, one can use the \f$ P_1\f$ (\f$ P_2\f$) values of Equations
\ref eqtaylor_along_line ( \ref eqtaylor_along_red_line) for a
max (min) ridge. The value of \f$ P_i\f$ for a ridge segment is defined as
the mean value of the \f$ P_i\f$ values of the two crossing points on edges
(while the value at a crossing point on an edge is the \f$ b_i\f$-weighted
mean value of the values at endpoints).
Alternatively, if third order differential quantities only are
available, one may use the geometric method developed in
\cgalCite{cgal:cp-tdare-05}.

Using the notion of ridge segment, a `Ridge_line` is defined as a
maximal connected sequence of ridge segments of the same type and connected
together. Notice that the topology of a `Ridge_line` is either
that of an interval or a circle.

<I> - Non-regular triangles.</I> In the neighborhood of umbilics,
triangle are less likely to be regular and the detection of ridges
cannot be relevant by this method. This is why we propose another
method to detect umbilics independently.

<b>Non compliant meshes: filtering ridges on <I>strength</I> and <I>sharpness</I>.</b>

For real world applications dealing with coarse meshes, or meshes
featuring degenerate regions or sharp features, or meshes conveying
some amount of noise, the <I>compliance</I> hypothesis
\cgalCite{cgal:cp-tdare-05} cannot be met. In that case, it still makes
sense to seek loci of points featuring extremality of estimated
principal curvatures, but the ridges reported may require
filtering. For example, if the principal curvatures are constant
- which is the case on a plane or a cylinder, then all points are
ridge points. In this context, an appealing notion is that of <I>sharp</I> ridge or <I>prominent</I> ridge. Since ridges are witnessed by
zero crossings of \f$ b_0\f$ and \f$ b_3\f$, one can expect erroneous detections
as long as these coefficients remain small. In order to select the
most prominent ridge points, we focus on points where the variation of
the curvature is fast along the curvature line. One can observe that,
at a ridge point, according to Equation
\ref eqtaylor_along_line, the second derivative of \f$ k_1\f$ along its
curvature line satisfies \f$ k_1^{''}(0) = P_1/(k_1-k_2)\f$. Using this
observation, one can define the <I>sharpness of a ridge</I> as the
integral of the absolute value of \f$ P_1/(k_1-k_2)\f$ along the ridge. As
the second derivative of the curvature is homogeneous to the inverse
of the cube of a length, the sharpness is homogeneous to the inverse
of the square of a length. Multiplying the sharpness by the square of
the model size gives a threshold and an associated sharpness-filter
which are scale independent. Another filtering is also available with
the <I>strength </I> which is the integral of the curvature along the
ridge line
\cgalCite{cgal:ybs-rvlmi-04}.

\section Ridges_3Approximating_1 Approximating Umbilics on Triangulated Surface Meshes

\anchor umbilicmesh

The method aims at identifying some vertices of a mesh as umbilics. It
assumes principal curvatures and directions are given at each vertex
on the mesh.

<b>Algorithm.</b>

Assume each vertex \f$ v\f$ of the mesh comes with a patch (a topological
disk) around it. Checking whether vertex \f$ v\f$ is an umbilic is a two
stages process, which are respectively concerned with the variation
of the function \f$ k_1-k_2\f$ over the patch, and the index of the vertex
computed from the boundary of the patch. More precisely, vertex \f$ v\f$ is
declared to be an umbilic if the following two conditions are met:
<UL>
<LI>the function \f$ k_1-k_2\f$ has its minimum at \f$ v\f$ amongst all the
vertices of the patch;
<LI>the deviation \f$ \delta\f$ of any principal direction along the patch
boundary, traversed counter-clock-wise (CCW), has prescribed
properties:
<UL>
<LI>\f$ \delta \in ]\pi/2,3\pi/2[\f$, then the umbilic is called elliptic,
<LI>\f$ \delta \in ]-3\pi/2,-\pi/2[\f$, then the umbilic is called a hyperbolic,
<LI>otherwise the umbilic is called non-generic.
</UL>
</UL>

<b>Finding patches around vertices.</b>

Given a vertex \f$ v\f$ and a parameter \f$ t\f$, we aim at defining a
collection of triangles around \f$ v\f$ so that (i) this collection defines
a topological disk on the triangulation \f$ T\f$ and (ii) its size depends
on \f$ t\f$. First we collect the 1-ring triangles. We define the size \f$ s\f$
of this 1-ring patch as the (Euclidean) distance from \f$ v\f$ to its
farthest 1-ring vertex neighbor. We then collect recursively adjacent
triangles so that the patch remains a topological disk and such that
these triangles are at distance less than \f$ s\times t\f$. Parameter \f$ t\f$
is the only parameter of the algorithm.

<b>Umbilical patches versus ridges.</b>
On a generic surface,
generic umbilics are traversed by one or three ridges. For compliant
meshes, an umbilic can thus be connected to the ridge points located
on the boundary of its patch. This functionality is not provided, and
the interested reader is referred to \cgalCite{cgal:cp-tdare-05} for more
details.

\section Ridges_3Software Software Design

\anchor soft

All classes of this package are templated by the parameter
`TriangleMesh`, which defines the type of the mesh to which the
approximation algorithms operate.

The differential quantities are provided at vertices of this mesh via
property maps, a concept commonly used in the Boost library.
Property maps enables the user
to store scalars and vectors associated to a vertex either
<I>internally</I> in extended vertices or <I>externally</I>
with a `std::map` combined with
a <A href="https://www.boost.org/libs/property_map/doc/associative_property_map.html">`boost::associative_property_map`</a>.

Output of ridges or umbilics are provided via output iterators.

Approximation of ridges and umbilics are performed by two independent
classes, which we now further describe.

\subsection Ridges_3RidgeApproximation Ridge Approximation

The main class is
`Ridge_approximation<TriangleMesh,VertexFTMap,VertexVectorMap>`.
Its construction requires the mesh and the property maps defining the
differential quantities for principal curvatures \f$ k_1\f$ and \f$ k_2\f$, the
third order extremalities \f$ b_0\f$ and \f$ b_3\f$, the principal directions of
curvature \f$ d_1\f$ and \f$ d_2\f$, and the fourth order quantities \f$ P_1\f$ and
\f$ P_2\f$ if the tagging of ridges as elliptic or hyperbolic is to be done using
the polynomials \f$ P_1\f$ and \f$ P_2\f$.

Three functions (provided as members and also as global functions)
enable the computation of different types of ridges :
<UL>
<LI>`compute_max_ridges()` (resp. `compute_min_ridges()`)
outputs ridges of types \ref MAX_ELLIPTIC_RIDGE and
\ref MAX_HYPERBOLIC_RIDGE (resp. `MIN_ELLIPTIC_RIDGE` and
\ref MIN_HYPERBOLIC_RIDGE).
<LI>`compute_crest_ridges()` outputs ridges of types
\ref MAX_CREST_RIDGE and \ref MIN_CREST_RIDGE.
</UL>

These functions allows the user to specify how the elliptic/hyperbolic
tagging is carried out.
Notice the rationale for the choice of these three functions is
simple: each computation needs a single pass over the triangles of the
mesh. This should be clear for the min and max ridges. For crests,
just notice max and min crests cannot intersect over a triangle.<BR>

<BR>

The ridge lines are stored in
`Ridge_line` objects and output through an iterator.
Each ridge line is represented as a list of halfedges of the mesh it
crosses with a scalar defining the barycentric coordinate of the
crossing point with respect to the half-egde endpoints. Each ridge
line comes with its type `Ridge_type`, its strength and sharpness.

If one chooses to use only third order quantities, the quantities
\f$ P_i\f$ do not have to be defined. Then the sharpness will not be
defined.

\subsection Ridges_3UmbilicApproximation Umbilic Approximation

The main class is
`Umbilic_approximation<TriangleMesh,VertexFTMap,VertexVectorMap>`.
Its construction requires the mesh and the property maps defining the
differential quantities for principal curvatures \f$ k_1\f$ and \f$ k_2\f$, and
the principal directions of curvature \f$ d_1\f$ and \f$ d_2\f$. The member
function `compute()` (or the global function `compute_umbilics()`)
has a parameter to define the size of the neighborhood of the umbilic.

Umbilics are stored in `Umbilic` objects, they come with their
type : \ref ELLIPTIC_UMBILIC, \ref HYPERBOLIC_UMBILIC or
\ref NON_GENERIC_UMBILIC; the vertex of the mesh they are associated
to and the list of half-edges representing the contour of the
neighborhood.


\section Ridges_3Examples Examples

\subsection Ridges_3Exampleprogram Example Program

The following program computes ridges and umbilics from an off
file. It uses the package \ref PkgJetFitting3 to estimate the differential
quantities.
The default output file gives rough data for visualization purpose, a
verbose output file may also be asked for. Parameters are
<UL>
<LI>\f$ d\f$, the degree of the jet for the `Monge_via_jet_fitting` class, \f$ d\f$
must be greater or equal to 3 which is the default value;
<LI>\f$ m\f$, the degree of the Monge representation for the
`Monge_via_jet_fitting` class, \f$ m\f$ must be 3 (the default value) or
4 and smaller than \f$ d\f$;
<LI>\f$ a\f$, the number of rings of neighbors collected for the
`Monge_via_jet_fitting` class, in addition the number of vertices
collected must be greater than \f$ Nd:=(d+1)(d+2)/2\f$ to make the
approximation possible. \f$ a\f$ may be an integer greater than 1, the value
0 (which is the default) means that the minimum number of rings is
collected to make the approximation possible. (Alternatively option \f$ p\f$
allows the specification of a constant number of neighbors);
<LI>\f$ t\f$, the `Ridge_order` for the distinction between elliptic and
hyperbolic ridges, \f$ t\f$ is 3 (default) or 4;
<LI>\f$ u\f$, the parameter for umbilic patch size, \f$ u \geq 1\f$ (default is 1).

\subsection Ridges_3ExampleFilteringofCrestRidgesona Example: Filtering of Crest Ridges on a Mechanical Part

\cgalFigureRef{figmechanical_crest_filteredintro} illustrates the filtering
of crest ridges on a mechanical model, and has been computed as follows:

\code{.cpp}
./Compute_Ridges_Umbilics -f data/rocker-arm.off -d 4 -m 4 -a 4 -t 4
\endcode

\cgalFigureBegin{figmechanical_crest_filteredintro,mecanic-sub1_crest-jpg.png}
Mechanical part (37k pts). Left: All crest lines. Middle:  crests filtered
with the strength threshold 1. Right: crests filtered with the
sharpness threshold 100 000. Notice that any point on a flat or
cylindrical part lies on two ridges, so that the noise observed on the
first two figures is unavoidable. It is however easily filtered out with
the sharpness as can be seen on the right figure.
