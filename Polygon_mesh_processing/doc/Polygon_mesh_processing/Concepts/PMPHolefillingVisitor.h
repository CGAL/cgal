/// The hole filling may use a 2D constrained triangulation
/// for almost planar holes (*planar phase*).  If that is not appropriate or fails it
/// may use an algorithm with a quadratic running time relying on the 3D Delaunay triangulation (*quadratic phase*).
/// If that fails, it uses an algorithm with cubic running time (*cubic phase*).
